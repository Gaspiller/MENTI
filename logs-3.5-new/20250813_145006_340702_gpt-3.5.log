[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于计算高血糖患者的实际钠水平？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和辅助检查结果，可以初步推断患者存在多个并发症，主要包括2型糖尿病性肾病、周围神经病变、周围血管病、高血压、脑梗死后遗症以及血脂代谢异常。由于患者尿液分析显示蛋白3+，血糖、血脂和血压控制并不理想，存在肾功能受损和心血管并发症的风险。同时，肌电图提示存在周围神经病变，可能导致双下肢麻痛不适、手足麻木等症状。综合来看，患者可能存在多个器官功能受损，特别是肾脏、神经和心血管系统。治疗方案中使用的药物可以有效控制血糖，并保护心肾功能，但治疗需长期进行以维持病情平稳。
