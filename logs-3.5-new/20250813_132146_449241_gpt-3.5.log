You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估肝硬化患者的肝功能和疾病严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

Based on the patient's case, the main abnormalities include liver cirrhosis, splenomegaly, hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease), heart failure with Class IV, pneumonia in both lungs, and bilateral pleural effusion. The liver function tests showed elevated levels of AST, GGT, cholinesterase, and bilirubin. The thyroid function tests indicate hyperthyroidism with low TSH, high FT3 and FT4 levels, and positive thyroid antibodies. The ultrasound results also confirm the enlarged thyroid gland with increased blood flow. The heart ultrasound shows an enlarged heart with a reduced ejection fraction, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation. The patient's CT scan shows signs of liver cirrhosis, splenomegaly, ascites, and bilateral pleural effusion.

Possible impaired bodily functions include liver function due to liver cirrhosis, thyroid function due to hyperthyroidism, heart function due to heart failure, and pulmonary function due to pneumonia and pleural effusion. Additional health monitoring and treatment may be required to manage these conditions effectively.
