[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估肾小球滤过率，特别适用于男性患者，以评估肾功能及预后？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病例信息，患者主要病情为慢性肾功能不全尿毒症期。这导致血肌酐和尿素升高，同时出现肾性贫血的现象，表明肾脏功能受损。在病史中还有心脏支架植入术后出现急性前壁心肌梗死的情况，心功能为3级，心脏病是一个重要并发症。另外，还发现血常规中血红蛋白偏低，白细胞升高，说明可能存在贫血和炎症反应。综合来看，患者可能存在肾功能下降、贫血、心脏病和肺炎等多种问题，需要综合治疗。
