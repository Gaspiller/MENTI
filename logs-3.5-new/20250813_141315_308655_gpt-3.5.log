[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于对上消化道出血患者进行风险评估和分层？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和诊断结果显示，患者患有十二指肠球部溃疡并出血，导致失血性贫血(中度)。这表明患者可能存在消化道出血的情况，导致贫血。治疗方案中提到了内镜下十二指肠钛夹止血术，进一步证实了消化道出血的确诊。因此，患者的消化功能可能受到影响，导致营养摄取不足、贫血等情况。
