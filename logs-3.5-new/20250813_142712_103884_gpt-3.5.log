    The QTc is used primarily to assess the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, especially torsades de pointes, 
    in patients with syncope or those receiving multiple QT-prolonging medications. A prolonged QT interval 
    can indicate a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This function corrects the QT interval to a heart rate 
    of 60 beats per minute, accounting for variations due to different heart rates.

    Parameters:
        qt_interval (float): The measured QT interval in milliseconds.

    - int: The Child-Pugh Score, ranging from 5 (best) to 15 (worst).

HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance): Calculate the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).

    The HOMA-IR is a clinical tool used to estimate insulin resistance (IR), which can be
    indicative of potential glucose intolerance and diabetes. It is particularly useful
    in scenarios where more invasive and time-consuming methods like the clamp measurement
    (considered the gold standard for measuring IR) are not feasible. Although the HOMA-IR
    provides a reasonable correlation with clamp measurements, it is less accurate on an
    individual basis, which suggests a need for caution in its clinical application and
    interpretation.

    Parameters:
    - fasting_insulin (float): The fasting insulin level in uIU/mL.
    - fasting_glucose (float): The fasting glucose level in mg/dL.

    - float: The estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR score).

    Formula:
    HOMA-IR score = (fasting insulin * fasting glucose) / 405

STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Calculate the STOP-BANG Score for screening Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

    This score is useful for patients undergoing preoperative evaluation but should not be used if a patient
    has already been diagnosed with OSA or uses CPAP at night. It helps in identifying patients who might have
    OSA and are at increased risk of perioperative cardiopulmonary complications, as well as other morbidity
    associated with OSA like daytime sleepiness and cardiopulmonary conditions.

    Parameters:
    - snore_loudly (bool): True if the patient snores loudly (louder than talking or loud enough to be heard through closed doors), False otherwise.
    - feel_tired_daytime (bool): True if the patient often feels tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime, False otherwise.
    - observed_apnea (bool): True if anyone has observed the patient stop breathing during sleep, False otherwise.

    >>> calculate_stop_bang_score(True, True, True, True, 36, 51, 41, 'Male')
    8

Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
