STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Calculate the STOP-BANG Score for screening Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

    This score is useful for patients undergoing preoperative evaluation but should not be used if a patient
    has already been diagnosed with OSA or uses CPAP at night. It helps in identifying patients who might have
    OSA and are at increased risk of perioperative cardiopulmonary complications, as well as other morbidity
    associated with OSA like daytime sleepiness and cardiopulmonary conditions.

    - feel_tired_daytime (bool): True if the patient often feels tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime, False otherwise.
    - observed_apnea (bool): True if anyone has observed the patient stop breathing during sleep, False otherwise.
    - high_blood_pressure (bool): True if the patient has or is being treated for high blood pressure, False otherwise.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:

    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.

        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)

GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7): Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
    based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
    2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

    This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders

    print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score


Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality: Calculate the Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality.

    The Child-Pugh Score helps estimate the prognosis for a patient with cirrhosis.

Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation): 
    Calculate the Creatinine Clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation.

    This function estimates kidney function, useful for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) staging
    and adjusting or discontinuing medications based on kidney function. It incorporates
    the patient's age, weight, sex, and serum creatinine levels to calculate the clearance rate.
    This is particularly relevant when considering medication dosages for patients with reduced
    kidney function, despite potential overestimations in GFR with newer creatinine assays.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Should be a positive integer.
    - weight (float): The weight of the patient in kilograms. Should be a positive decimal.
    - creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level in mg/dL. Should be a positive decimal.
    - sex (str): The sex of the patient. Acceptable values are 'male' or 'female'.
                 This affects the calculation as there is a different multiplier for females.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated creatinine clearance in mL/min.
    
    Example:
    >>> calculate_creatinine_clearance(50, 70, 1.2, 'female')
    49.30555555555556
  

Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia: Calculate the corrected calcium level in patients with suspected hypocalcemia
    who have low albumin levels. Hypocalcemia might not be apparent if serum albumin is low,
    thus this formula adjusts the calcium level based on albumin discrepancy.

    Args:
    normal_albumin (float): The normal albumin level in g/dL assumed for the calculation.
    patient_albumin (float): The patient's measured albumin level in g/dL.
    serum_ca (float): The patient's measured serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: The corrected serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Example:
    >>> corrected_calcium(4.0, 3.2, 8.5)
    8.84
 

Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS): Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表被用于评估患者的意识状态和昏迷程度？}}
Task Scenario: {{根据患者的病史和体格检查，患者出现昏迷且伴有呕吐，没有药物或食物中毒的病史。辅助检查未发现明显的心脑血管问题，但血糖在正常范围，暗示可能不是因为高血糖导致的昏迷。肝功能、肾功能以及血液分析指标基本正常。外生殖器没有异常，四肢没有畸形，下肢没有浮肿，病理反射未引出。

基于上述分析，可以推测患者的昏迷可能与中枢神经系统相关，如脑部问题导致的，但具体原因还需要进一步的神经系统检查以及头颅影像学检查来确定。}}
