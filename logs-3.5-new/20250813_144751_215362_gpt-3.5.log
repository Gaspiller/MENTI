You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk', 'ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'APACHE II Score', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk', 'CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity', 'Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)', 'PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events:  Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表用于评估手术前患者的心脏手术后风险？}}
Task Scenario: {{Analysis:
1. The patient presented with a history of a positive urine HCG test after a 40-day menstrual delay, indicating a possible pregnancy. This was further confirmed by the presence of fetal movement and a positive result for 21-trisomy syndrome in the umbilical cord blood test.
2. The decision to induce labor was made due to the high-risk factor of 21-trisomy syndrome in the fetus.
3. The patient did not report any significant abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, headaches, dizziness, or other alarming symptoms during the pregnancy period.
4. The patient denied a history of chronic diseases, surgeries, traumas, or blood transfusions.

Impaired bodily functions:
Based on the provided information, the main impairment could be in the genetic makeup of the fetus, leading to the diagnosis of 21-trisomy syndrome. This condition results from the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21, leading to developmental delays and physical abnormalities. The decision to induce labor was likely made to address the complications associated with this genetic anomaly.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. The user demand is to identify the tool used to assess the pre-operative cardiac risk in patients undergoing surgery.
2. The task scenario involves a patient with a confirmed case of 21-trisomy syndrome in the fetus and the decision to induce labor due to the high-risk factor associated with this genetic condition.
3. Given the scenario, the tool that best fits the user demand is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
4. This tool is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent non-cardiac surgery, which aligns with the need to evaluate cardiac risk in the context of the patient's impending labor induction procedure.
