2025-08-13 14:43:29,811 - INFO - 1. From the User Demand, we are looking for a tool that assesses the cardiac surgical risk of a patient before knee internal fixation surgery.
2. To assess the cardiac risk of the patient in this scenario, we need a tool that specifically evaluates the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
3. The tool that fits this description from the tool list is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk".
4. This tool calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery.
5. Considering the patient's history of heart failure, post-pacemaker surgery, and potential cardiac abnormalities, using the Revised Cardiac Risk Index would be appropriate to evaluate the patient's cardiac risk before knee internal fixation surgery.

   - The patient has a history of myocardial infarction (MI) as mentioned in the reference text.
   - Fill: True

3. history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool):
   - Signs of congestive heart failure such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales, S3 gallop are mentioned in the reference text.

4. history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool):
   - The patient has no history of cerebrovascular disease mentioned in the reference text.
   - Fill: False

5. preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool):
   - The patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively for diabetes.

2025-08-13 14:43:43,692 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
