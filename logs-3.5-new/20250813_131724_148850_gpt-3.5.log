    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.
    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.
 

Wells' Criteria for DVT: Calculate the Wells' Criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).

    This scale helps clinicians in outpatient and emergency settings to stratify patients' risk of DVT. A score below 2, coupled with a negative d-dimer test, allows clinicians to rule out DVT without the need for ultrasound imaging. This method balances the need for accurate diagnosis with the resource and time costs associated with more invasive tests.

    Parameters:
    active_cancer (bool): True if the patient has active cancer (treatment within last 6 months).
    bedridden_recently (bool): True if the patient was bedridden for more than 3 days recently or had major surgery within the last 12 weeks.

    entire_leg_swollen (bool): True if the entire leg is swollen.
    localized_tenderness (bool): True if there is localized tenderness along the deep venous system.
    pitting_edema (bool): True if there is pitting edema confined to the symptomatic leg.
    recent_immobilization (bool): True if the patient had paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities.
    previous_dvt (bool): True if the patient has a history of documented DVT.
    alternative_diagnosis (bool): True if an alternative diagnosis is as likely or more likely than DVT.

    Returns:
    int: Wells' score for DVT, where higher values indicate a higher probability of DVT.

    Usage:
    score = calculate_wells_criteria_dvt(True, False, True, True, False, True, True, False, True, False)
