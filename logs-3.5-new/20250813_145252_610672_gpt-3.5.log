[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于计算高血糖患者的实际钠水平？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和辅助检查结果，可以推测患者出现呕吐、腹泻、意识不清的主要原因可能与低血糖有关。随机血糖为2.6mmol/L，低于正常范围，可能导致大脑功能受损，出现意识模糊、头晕等症状。同时，患者患有高血压和糖尿病，对血糖的调节能力可能受到影响。建议进一步监测血糖水平并调整药物治疗以稳定血糖水平，避免再次出现类似症状。
