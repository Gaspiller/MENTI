2. 根据任务场景描述，患者主要症状为咳嗽、咳痰、伴随胸痛，胸CT显示双侧支气管扩张伴肺病感染。心电图显示心律不齐，心肌缺血。辅助检查中BUN值偏低，可能存在肾功能异常。

根据情况分析，最适合的工具是ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications，因为患者主要存在肺部感染的情况，该工具可以帮助预测患者术后肺部并发症的风险，对于评估肺部问题非常有用。

2025-08-13 14:59:06,391 - INFO - 1. age:
   - The patient is a 65-year-old male.
   - Therefore, the value for age is 65.

2. spo2:
   - The reference text does not provide the preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) percentage.
   - Since there is no specific mention of any respiratory complications in the reference text, we will assume a normal value for SpO2, which is typically around 95-100% in healthy individuals.
   - Therefore, the value for spo2 is assumed to be 98%.

3. respiratory_infection:
   - The reference text mentions that the patient has been experiencing cough and sputum for over 10 days, with worsening accompanied by intermittent chest pain for 2 days. Chest CT shows bilateral bronchiectasis with lung infection.
   - There is a clear indication of a respiratory infection in the patient.
   - Therefore, the value for respiratory_infection is 1 (Yes).

4. anemia:
   - There is no specific mention of anemia in the reference text.
   - Since there is no indication of anemia, we will assume the absence of preoperative anemia.
   - Therefore, the value for anemia is 0 (No).

5. surgical_incision:
   - The reference text does not provide information regarding the type of surgical incision.
   - We will assume a type of surgery that is common for the patient's condition. In this case, we will assume an upper abdominal surgical incision, considering the respiratory infection and potential thoracic involvement.
   - Therefore, the value for surgical_incision is 1 (Upper abdominal).

6. surgery_duration:
   - The reference text does not mention the duration of the surgery.
   - Since the text does not provide this information, we will assume a standard duration of 2 hours for the surgery.
   - Therefore, the value for surgery_duration is 2 hours.

7. emergency:
   - The reference text does not specify whether the procedure was an emergency or not.
   - Since there is no mention of an emergency procedure, we will assume that it was not an emergency case.
   - Therefore, the value for emergency is 0 (No).

Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications.
    This score helps predict the risk of pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery under general, neuraxial, or regional anesthesia.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    spo2 (int): Preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) percentage.
    respiratory_infection (int): Indicates the presence of respiratory infection in the last month. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
    anemia (int): Indicates preoperative anemia (Hgb ≤10 g/dL). 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
    surgical_incision (int): Type of surgical incision. 0 for 'Peripheral', 1 for 'Upper abdominal', 2 for 'Intrathoracic'.
    surgery_duration (int): Duration of the surgery in hours.
    emergency (int): Indicates if the procedure was an emergency. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.

    Returns:
    int: The ARISCAT score, which is a summation of points based on the provided parameters.
