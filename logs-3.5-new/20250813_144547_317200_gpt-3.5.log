You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance)', 'Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk', 'STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk', 'Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity', 'Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator', 'ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications', 'CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity', 'APACHE II Score', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance): Calculate the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).

    The HOMA-IR is a clinical tool used to estimate insulin resistance (IR), which can be
    indicative of potential glucose intolerance and diabetes. It is particularly useful
    in scenarios where more invasive and time-consuming methods like the clamp measurement
    (considered the gold standard for measuring IR) are not feasible. Although the HOMA-IR
    provides a reasonable correlation with clamp measurements, it is less accurate on an
    individual basis, which suggests a need for caution in its clinical application and
    interpretation.

    Parameters:
    - fasting_insulin (float): The fasting insulin level in uIU/mL.
    - fasting_glucose (float): The fasting glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR score).

    Formula:
    HOMA-IR score = (fasting insulin * fasting glucose) / 405

Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk: Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.

Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity: Calculate the Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity using the Smithline-Gardner Formula.

    This function calculates the serum osmolality/osmolarity based on the concentrations of sodium, glucose,
    and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the blood. Serum osmolality is a measure of the solute concentration in the blood,
    and it can be used to assess the body's fluid and electrolyte balance. An osmolar gap (difference between measured
    and expected osmolality) greater than 10 can indicate the presence of certain toxic alcohols, mannitol, or propylene glycol.

    Note: At extreme levels of serum glucose, such as in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), the osmolar gap may be skewed,
    and clinical judgment should be used.

    Parameters:
    serum_na (float): Serum sodium concentration in mmol/L. Typical reference range is 135-145 mmol/L.
    serum_glucose (float): Serum glucose concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 70-100 mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: Calculated serum osmolality in mOsm/kg.

    Formula:
    Serum Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 2 * (serum_na) + (serum_glucose / 18) + (serum_bun / 2.8)


Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator: Calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

    which considers the first trimester ultrasound measurements to be the most accurate method to establish gestational age.

    Parameters:
    - cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
                           If cycle_length is more than 28, the difference is added to the 40-week period.
    - last_menstrual_period (str): The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

    Returns:
    - str: The estimated due date in the format 'Day, Month DD, YYYY'.

    Usage:
    The function is intended for use by healthcare providers to estimate due dates for pregnant patients,
    which can help in managing pregnancy timelines effectively and in planning medical care accordingly.

User Demand: {{The preop_treatment_with_insulin parameter value is missing. It needs to be assigned a boolean value in accordance with the Function Docstring requirements.}}
Task Scenario: {{}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. The User Demand states that the preop_treatment_with_insulin parameter value is missing and needs to be assigned a boolean value.
2. Based on the provided tools list and the missing parameter, the suitable tool to choose would be the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" tool.
3. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index tool requires the following boolean parameters:
    - elevated_risk_surgery
    - history_of_ischemic_heart_disease
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure
    - history_of_cerebrovascular_disease
    - preop_treatment_with_insulin
    - preop_creatinine_above_threshold
4. Since the missing parameter is preop_treatment_with_insulin, we can assign it a boolean value based on the given information. Let's assume the patient is not being treated with insulin pre-operatively, so we will assign it as False.
5. Therefore, the chosen tool is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
