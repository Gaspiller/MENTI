2. 从工具列表中选择符合要求的量表。
3. 通过分析患者的病情描述和检查结果，发现患者已被诊断为冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病、高血压病、高脂血症、脑动脉狭窄等，主要症状为发作性胸痛，持续时间延长并伴随着背部和上臂疼痛，与心绞痛特征相符。
4. 由于患者存在心脏疾病和脑血管问题，需要选择一个可以评估心血管风险的量表。在工具列表中，"HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"是用于风险分层急诊科胸痛患者的工具，可帮助预测患者发生急性冠脉综合征的风险。
5. 因此，选择"HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"作为满足用户需求的工具。

2025-08-13 14:22:55,674 - INFO - 1. history_score:
   - According to the patient's medical history of coronary artery atherosclerotic heart disease, hypertension, and high lipidemia, with a high level of suspicion, the history_score can be inferred as 2.

2. ekg_score:
   - The EKG findings are not explicitly mentioned in the reference text. Since the patient's EKG is normal, the ekg_score can be inferred as 0.

3. age_score:
   - The patient is a 55-year-old male, falling into the age category of 65 or older, so the age_score can be inferred as 2.

4. risk_factors_score:
   - The patient has a history of high lipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic heart disease which are multiple cardiovascular risk factors, so the risk_factors_score can be inferred as 2.

5. troponin_score:
   - The troponin levels are mentioned to be within the normal range, so the troponin_score can be inferred as 0.

2025-08-13 14:23:03,496 - INFO - {{Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
