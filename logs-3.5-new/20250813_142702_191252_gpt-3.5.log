You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的平均动脉压？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和辅助检查结果，可以得出以下结论：
1. 患者被诊断为扩心病、慢性心功能不全，心功能III级，合并左束支阻塞。
2. 心脏超声显示左心为主、全心增大、左室收缩功能减低，提示心脏功能受损。
3. NT-Pro BNP水平升高，证实心脏功能存在异常。
4. ECG显示完全性左束支传导阻滞，心律失常严重，可能影响心脏传导功能。

可能受损的生理功能包括心脏的收缩功能，心脏的传导功能和心脏的泵血功能。这些异常导致了症状加重，如胸闷气短、心律失常等。治疗方案中给予利钠肽减轻心脏负荷、改善心衰治疗，以及对症治疗，均旨在改善心脏功能和减轻症状。
