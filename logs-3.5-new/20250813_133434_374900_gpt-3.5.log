[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估肺炎患者的严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和临床表现，可以初步推断患者可能患有右肺部感染，导致右肺下叶炎性改变和胸膜肥厚以及积液。这可能影响患者的呼吸功能，导致咳嗽、咳痰等症状。同时，由于肺部感染可能影响到氧气交换功能，患者可能出现呼吸频率增加、心率增快等情况。需要进一步监测患者的肺部病情和呼吸功能，及时进行治疗。
