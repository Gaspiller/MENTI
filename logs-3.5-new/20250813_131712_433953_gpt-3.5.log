[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估手术患者的静脉血栓栓塞症（VTE）风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病史介绍和辅助检查结果，患者出现了头痛、左侧肢体麻木，颅内静脉窦非化脓性血栓形成的诊断。此病情可能影响到患者的神经功能，导致左侧肢体乏力、麻木感、感觉减退等症状。治疗过程中采取的硫辛酸注射液、甲钴胺注射液、甘露醇针、呋塞米注射液和低分子量肝素钠注射液等对症治疗，也显示出了病情有所好转。
