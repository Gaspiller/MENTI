[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估ICU患者的严重程度和预测死亡率？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和辅助检查结果显示，患儿患有支气管炎，脓毒血症可能性，并有EB病毒感染。血气分析结果显示代谢性酸中毒合并呼吸性碱中毒和高乳酸血症。治疗结果显示无抽搐，复查感染指标均正常。

可能受影响的身体功能：呼吸系统（支气管炎，呼吸性碱中毒）、免疫系统（EB病毒感染，脓毒血症）、代谢系统（代谢性酸中毒，高乳酸血症）。
