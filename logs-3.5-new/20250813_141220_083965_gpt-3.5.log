You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的意识状态和昏迷程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

Based on the patient's case, the main abnormality is the ingestion of a large quantity of the sedative drug "diazepam" (Valium), leading to symptoms such as altered mental status, unclear speech, and unresponsiveness. The patient was found with dilated pupils that were slow to react to light, indicating possible central nervous system depression. Additionally, the patient's muscle tone and strength were reduced, and they exhibited uncooperative behavior.

The abnormal results in the laboratory tests, including prolonged thrombin time (TT) and decreased fibrinogen (FIB) levels, elevated homocysteine (HCYB) and lipoprotein (a) (LP(a)), decreased total protein (TP) and globulin (GLO) levels, and increased iron (Fe) levels, suggest possible liver dysfunction and metabolic disturbances due to the drug overdose.

In conclusion, the ingestion of a large quantity of diazepam has led to central nervous system depression, impaired muscle function, and possible liver dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities in this patient. Immediate medical intervention and supportive care are necessary to address these underlying issues.
