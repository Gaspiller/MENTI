2025-08-13 14:14:44,167 - INFO - 1. The user demand is to select a tool used to assess the severity of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and prognosis risk.
2. Given the task scenario which includes upper gastrointestinal bleeding, moderate anemia, unstable angina, hypertension, and previous cerebral infarction, it is important to focus on a tool that specifically evaluates bleeding risk and prognosis in such a complex clinical setting.
3. Considering the factors involved in the scenario such as impaired blood clotting mechanisms, impaired coronary blood flow, hypertension, and previous cerebral infarction, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the "HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk".
4. The HAS-BLED Score is designed to estimate the risk of major bleeding in patients with atrial fibrillation, taking into account factors like hypertension, renal disease, liver disease, stroke history, major bleeding history, labile INR, age, medication risk, and alcohol usage.
5. Calculating the HAS-BLED Score for the patient based on the provided parameters will help in assessing the bleeding risk associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and other conditions mentioned in the scenario.
6. Therefore, the tool "HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk" is the most appropriate choice for evaluating the bleeding severity and prognosis risk in the given clinical scenario.

   - In the Reference Text, there is a mention of "high blood pressure" (高血压病), which indicates that the patient has hypertension.
   - Value: True

2. renal_disease (bool):
   - There is no explicit mention of renal disease in the Reference Text. However, since the patient has undergone dialysis in the past, it can be inferred that the patient has renal disease.
   - Value: True

3. liver_disease (bool):
   - The Reference Text does not provide explicit information about liver disease. Since there is no mention of liver issues, it can be assumed that the patient does not have liver disease.
   - Value: False

4. stroke_history (bool):
   - The Reference Text mentions a history of "old cerebral infarction" (陈旧性脑梗死), indicating a previous stroke.
   - Value: True

5. major_bleeding_history (bool):
   - Although there is no direct mention of major bleeding history in the Reference Text, the patient's current condition includes upper gastrointestinal bleeding (上消化道出血), which can be considered prior major bleeding.
   - Value: True

6. labile_inr (bool):
   - There is no specific mention of labile INR or unstable/high INRs in the Reference Text. Since it is not explicitly stated, the assumption can be made that the patient does not have labile INR.
   - Value: False

7. elderly (bool):
   - The patient's age is mentioned as 54 years, which does not meet the criteria for being considered elderly (>65 years).
   - Value: False

8. medication_risk (bool):
   - There is no direct reference to medications predisposing to bleeding (aspirin, clopidogrel, NSAIDs) in the Reference Text. Since it is not mentioned, it can be assumed that the patient does not use such medication.
   - Value: False
  
9. alcohol_usage (bool):
   - The Reference Text does not specify the patient's alcohol consumption level (≥8 drinks/week).
   - Given the lack of information, the assumption can be made that the patient's alcohol consumption is not significant.
   - Value: False

{{Calculate the HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.
    
    The HAS-BLED Score is used to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding and helps guide decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy.
    This scoring system can be considered alongside other bleeding risk scores or thromboembolic risk assessments to weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation.

    Parameters:
    hypertension (bool): True if the patient has hypertension, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has renal disease (dialysis, transplant, or Cr >2.26 mg/dL), False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has liver disease (cirrhosis or bilirubin >2x normal with AST/ALT/AP >3x normal), False otherwise.
    stroke_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, False otherwise.
    major_bleeding_history (bool): True if the patient has had prior major bleeding or predisposition to bleeding, False otherwise.
    labile_inr (bool): True if the patient has labile INR (unstable/high INRs, time in therapeutic range <60%), False otherwise.
    elderly (bool): True if the patient is elderly (age >65), False otherwise.
    medication_risk (bool): True if the patient uses medication that predisposes to bleeding (aspirin, clopidogrel, NSAIDs), False otherwise.
    alcohol_usage (bool): True if the patient consumes alcohol significantly (≥8 drinks/week), False otherwise.

    Returns:
    int: The total HAS-BLED score, which is a sum of all applicable risk factors.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_has_bled_score(True, False, False, True, False, True, True, False, True)
