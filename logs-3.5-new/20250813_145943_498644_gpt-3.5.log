You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}

    Calculate the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.

    The CURB-65 calculator can be used in the emergency department setting to risk stratify a patient’s community acquired pneumonia.
    It includes points for confusion, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age.
    
    Parameters:
    confusion (int): Confusion status, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes.
    bun (int): Blood urea nitrogen status, where 0 = BUN ≤ 19 mg/dL (≤ 7 mmol/L urea) and 1 = BUN > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L urea).
    respiratory_rate (int): Respiratory rate status, where 0 = < 30 breaths/min and 1 = ≥ 30 breaths/min.
    blood_pressure (int): Blood pressure status, where 0 = Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg, and 1 = Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg.
    age (int): Age status, where 0 = < 65 years and 1 = ≥ 65 years.

    Returns:
    int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

    Usage:
    This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.
    
    Example:
    >>> curb_65_score(1, 1, 1, 0, 1)

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. confusion:
According to the Reference Text, there is no mention of confusion status, so we need to infer this. As the patient is a 1-year-old male with fever-induced convulsion, it is likely that he is confused or agitated. Therefore, we can infer that confusion is present. Let's set "confusion" to 1.

2. bun:
The BUN level provided in the Reference Text is 5.6mmol/L. According to the Function Docstring, a BUN level of ≤ 7 mmol/L urea corresponds to bun = 0 and > 7 mmol/L urea corresponds to bun = 1. Since 5.6mmol/L is less than 7 mmol/L, let's set "bun" to 0.

3. respiratory_rate:
The respiratory_rate status in the Reference Text is not explicitly provided. However, considering the fever and respiratory symptoms, it is possible that the respiratory rate is elevated (≥ 30 breaths/min). Let's set "respiratory_rate" to 1.

4. blood_pressure:
The blood pressure provided in the Reference Text is 72/51mmHg. According to the Function Docstring, a blood pressure of Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg corresponds to blood_pressure = 0, and Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg corresponds to blood_pressure = 1. Since both the systolic and diastolic blood pressures are below the threshold values, let's set "blood_pressure" to 1.

5. age:
The age of the patient is 1 year and 7 months. This corresponds to less than 65 years of age. Let's set "age" to 0.

```json
{
    "confusion": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"},
    "bun": {"Value": 0, "Unit": "null"},
    "respiratory_rate": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"},
