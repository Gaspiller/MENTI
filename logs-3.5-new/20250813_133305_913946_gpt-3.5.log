You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}
Step By Step Analysis:
{{Here is your step-by-step analysis.}}
Parameters List:
```json
{
    "weight": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "kg"},
    "height": {"Value": 175, "Unit": "cm"}
}
```

Begin!

Function Docstring: 
{{Convert the value of Creatinine from the input_unit to the target_unit and print the conversion result in natural language.
    units list = ['mmol/L', 'µmol/L', 'mg/dL', 'mg/100mL', 'mg%', 'mg/L', 'µg/mL']

    Parameters:
        - input_value (float): The numeric value to convert.
        - input_unit (int): The index of the unit for the input_value in the units list.
        - target_unit (int): The index of the unit to which the value is to be converted(target_unit) in the units list.

    Returns:
        - str: A string stating the conversion result in a natural language format.

    Notes:
        - The `units` list is defined with the names of each unit as strings, corresponding to the indices used in input_unit and target_unit.
        - The `factors` list is defined with numeric values that represent the conversion factors from each unit to a common base unit.}}
Reference Text:
{{The serum_creatinine is 104.2 umol/L. It needs to be converted from umol/L to mg/dL.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Parameter 'input_value':
   - Value: 104.2
   - Unit: umol/L

2. Parameter 'input_unit':
   - Value: 1 (index representing umol/L in the units list)

3. Parameter 'target_unit':
   - Value: 2 (index representing mg/dL in the units list)

Parameters List:
```json
{
    "input_value": {"Value": 104.2, "Unit": "umol/L"},
    "input_unit": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"},
    "target_unit": {"Value": 2, "Unit": "null"}
}
```
