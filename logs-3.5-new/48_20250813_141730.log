2. 根据病例信息描述，患者出现了左心增大、左心室功能减低、左室前壁运动减低以及肺动脉高压和三尖瓣返流等异常表现，需要关注心衰等并发症的发展。

3. 综合考虑病例描述的心脏功能异常和血流问题，选择适合的量表是"HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"，因为该量表可用于评估急诊科胸痛患者的急性冠脉综合征（ACS）风险，符合病例中涉及到的心衰等并发症风险评估需求。

4. 因此，最适合的工具是"HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"。

2025-08-13 14:17:54,648 - INFO - 1. history_score:
- In the Reference Text, there is no direct mention of the patient's history score based on the provided scoring system.
- Since the patient is 65 years old and has multiple clinical findings related to heart issues, we can infer that the history_score might be "2" (Highly suspicious) according to the seriousness of the situation.

2. ekg_score:
- The EKG findings mentioned in the Reference Text indicate abnormal ST segment elevation and Q wave formation, which are indicative of significant heart issues.
- Based on these findings, the ekg_score should be "2" (Significant ST deviation).

3. age_score:
- The patient's age is clearly stated as 65 years old in the Reference Text.
- According to the age ranges provided, the age_score should be "2" (65 or older).

4. risk_factors_score:
- There is no specific mention of the patient's cardiovascular risk factors in the Reference Text.
- However, given the clinical diagnosis of heart-related issues and the patient's age, it is reasonable to assume that the patient may have multiple risk factors or a history of atherosclerotic disease.
- Therefore, the risk_factors_score should be "2" (3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease).

5. troponin_score:
- The troponin levels provided in the Reference Text indicate significantly elevated levels which suggest heart muscle damage.
- Based on the troponin levels, the troponin_score should be "2" (>3 times normal limit).

Parameters List:

2025-08-13 14:18:00,974 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Args:
history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
    0 = Slightly suspicious,
    1 = Moderately suspicious,
    2 = Highly suspicious.
ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
    0 = Normal,
    1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
    2 = Significant ST deviation.
age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
    0 = less than 45,
    1 = between 45 and 64,
    2 = 65 or older.
risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
    0 = No known risk factors,
    1 = 1–2 risk factors,
    2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
    0 = ≤ normal limit,
    1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
    2 = >3 times normal limit.

Returns:
int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
     in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
     0-3 points indicate low risk,
     4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
     7-10 points indicate high risk.

Example:
>>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
7
