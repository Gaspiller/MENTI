You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的肝纤维化程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

 分析:

根据提供的患者病史和辅助检查结果，可以看出患者患有乙型肝炎、急性黄疸型，同时合并EB病毒感染。乙型肝炎病毒在患者体内复制，导致肝功能指标如AST、ALT等酶值明显升高，肝功能受损。EB病毒感染也会对肝脏造成额外的损害。由于病毒感染，患者出现了黄疸症状，表明肝脏无法正常代谢胆红素，造成其在血液中积累，导致皮肤、巩膜发生黄染。

可能受损的生理功能包括肝脏的代谢功能、解毒功能和胆汁分泌功能。这些病症可能导致患者肝功能减退，有可能会引起肝功能衰竭等严重后果。治疗方案中包括抗感染、保肝、退黄等治疗，是为了减轻肝脏负担，帮助肝脏恢复功能，从而改善病情。
