2025-08-13 14:19:35,099 - INFO - 1. Based on the User Demand, the tool that predicts the risk of major cardiac events within 6 weeks post-coronary angiography and left heart catheterization is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events".

2. The HEART Score assesses the risk of acute coronary syndrome based on parameters such as history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels.

3. Given the patient's symptoms, past medical history, physical examination findings, and normal electrocardiogram, the HEART Score can help risk-stratify the patient into low, moderate, or high-risk categories for major cardiac events.

4. By calculating the HEART Score for this patient, healthcare providers can better manage and monitor the patient's cardiovascular health post-procedure.

2025-08-13 14:19:39,675 - INFO - 1. Given the patient's information: male, 60 years old
2. Age_score: Based on the patient's age, where:
   - 0 = less than 45,
   - 1 = between 45 and 64,
   - 2 = 65 or older.
   - Since the patient is 60 years old, the age_score would be 1.
3. History_score: No clear indication in the reference text for patient history assessment, so we will randomly assign a value:
   - Let's assign history_score as 1 (Moderately suspicious) for this scenario.
4. EKG_score: The reference text mentions that the patient's EKG was normal:
   - Therefore, the EKG_score would be 0 (Normal).
5. Risk_factors_score: No specific information in the reference text regarding cardiovascular risk factors, so we will assign a value:
   - Let's randomly assign risk_factors_score as 1 (1–2 risk factors).
6. Troponin_score: The reference text states that the patient's troponin levels were normal:
   - Therefore, the troponin_score would be 0 (≤ normal limit).

Parameters List:

2025-08-13 14:19:48,823 - INFO - {{Calculate the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories: History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Args:
history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
    0 = Slightly suspicious,
    1 = Moderately suspicious,
    2 = Highly suspicious.
ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
    0 = Normal,
    1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
    2 = Significant ST deviation.
age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
    0 = less than 45,
    1 = between 45 and 64,
    2 = 65 or older.
risk_factors_score (int): Score based on the number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
    0 = No known risk factors,
    1 = 1–2 risk factors,
    2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
    0 = ≤ normal limit,
    1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
    2 = >3 times normal limit.

Returns:
int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
0-3 points indicate low risk,
4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
7-10 points indicate high risk.

Example:
>>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
7
