Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.
    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.

    Returns:
    - int: The Child-Pugh Score, ranging from 5 (best) to 15 (worst).

HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance): Calculate the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).

    The HOMA-IR is a clinical tool used to estimate insulin resistance (IR), which can be
    indicative of potential glucose intolerance and diabetes. It is particularly useful
    in scenarios where more invasive and time-consuming methods like the clamp measurement
    (considered the gold standard for measuring IR) are not feasible. Although the HOMA-IR
    provides a reasonable correlation with clamp measurements, it is less accurate on an
    individual basis, which suggests a need for caution in its clinical application and
    interpretation.

    Parameters:
    - fasting_insulin (float): The fasting insulin level in uIU/mL.
    - fasting_glucose (float): The fasting glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR score).

    Formula:
    HOMA-IR score = (fasting insulin * fasting glucose) / 405

HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk: Calculate the HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.
    
    The HAS-BLED Score is used to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding and helps guide decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy.
    This scoring system can be considered alongside other bleeding risk scores or thromboembolic risk assessments to weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation.

    Parameters:
    hypertension (bool): True if the patient has hypertension, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has renal disease (dialysis, transplant, or Cr >2.26 mg/dL), False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has liver disease (cirrhosis or bilirubin >2x normal with AST/ALT/AP >3x normal), False otherwise.
    stroke_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, False otherwise.
    major_bleeding_history (bool): True if the patient has had prior major bleeding or predisposition to bleeding, False otherwise.
    labile_inr (bool): True if the patient has labile INR (unstable/high INRs, time in therapeutic range <60%), False otherwise.
    elderly (bool): True if the patient is elderly (age >65), False otherwise.
    medication_risk (bool): True if the patient uses medication that predisposes to bleeding (aspirin, clopidogrel, NSAIDs), False otherwise.

    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
