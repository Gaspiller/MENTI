You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'Corrected QT Interval (QTc)', 'ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications', 'Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events:  Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
