2025-08-13 14:30:35,882 - INFO - 1. The user demand is to identify which assessment tool is used to evaluate the severity of depression in a patient.
2. Based on the user demand, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9).
3. The PHQ-9 is specifically designed to diagnose depression and quantify the severity of depressive symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder.
4. The PHQ-9 assesses various symptoms of depression such as interest/pleasure, feeling down, sleep issues, tiredness, appetite problems, self-esteem issues, concentration difficulties, activity levels, and suicidal thoughts.
5. Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3 based on the frequency and severity of the symptoms.
6. The total PHQ-9 score is the sum of individual scores for each symptom, providing an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.
7. Therefore, the PHQ-9 tool would be the most appropriate choice for evaluating the severity of depression in the described patient scenario.

2025-08-13 14:30:44,948 - INFO - 1. interest_pleasure:
Based on the symptoms described in the Reference Text, the patient shows signs of diminished interest or pleasure in doing things, as indicated by her decreased interest in activities she previously enjoyed. This can be scored as 2 ('More than half the days').

2. feeling_down:
The patient clearly exhibits symptoms of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless, as evidenced by her negative emotions, constant worrying, and expressions of sadness. This can be scored as 3 ('Nearly every day').

3. sleep_issues:
The patient experiences sleep disturbances, including difficulty falling asleep, early morning awakening, and insufficient sleep, which indicates significant sleep issues. This can be scored as 3 ('Nearly every day').

4. tired_energy:
There is a significant mention of fatigue and low energy levels in the patient, such as feeling tired all the time and only sleeping a few hours each day. This can be scored as 3 ('Nearly every day').

5. appetite_issues:
While there is no specific mention of appetite-related problems in the Reference Text, a lack of appetite or overeating is common in individuals with depression. Given the patient's overall condition, it can be inferred that she may be experiencing appetite disturbances. This can be scored as 2 ('More than half the days').

6. self_feeling:
The patient expresses feelings of low self-worth, self-blame, and suicidal ideation. These symptoms align with feelings of being bad about oneself or like a failure. This can be scored as 3 ('Nearly every day').

7. concentration:
The patient exhibits difficulties in concentration and focusing, as indicated by her inability to sleep due to constant worrying, calculating money, and expressing confusion. This can be scored as 3 ('Nearly every day').

2025-08-13 14:30:54,616 - INFO - {{Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
- "0" for 'Not at all'
- "1" for 'Several days'
- "2" for 'More than half the days'
- "3" for 'Nearly every day'
The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

Parameters:
- interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
- feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
- sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
- tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
- appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
- self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
- concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
- activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
- suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

Returns:
- int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.
