2025-08-19 20:09:23,048 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess the degree of liver fibrosis in HBV patients. This aligns with the "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis" tool from the provided Tool List.

2. The Task Scenario mentions the possibility of liver function impairment in the patient, which further supports the choice of the "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis" tool as it specifically calculates the FIB-4 Index to estimate liver fibrosis.

3. The Task Scenario also describes abnormal liver-related parameters, which are essential in assessing liver fibrosis, reinforcing the relevance of the "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis" tool selection.

Based on the detailed analysis, the most suitable tool for the User Demand and Task Scenario is the "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis."

2025-08-19 20:09:28,851 - INFO - {{"Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

    Parameters:
        age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.
        ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.
        platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).
        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.
