2025-08-19 20:21:20,836 - INFO - 1. The core keyword in the User Demand is "平均动脉压" (Mean Arterial Pressure), which is a specific physiological parameter related to cardiovascular function.
2. The Task Scenario mentions a primary concern of pulmonary heart disease, which can lead to increased cardiac load, right ventricular enlargement, pulmonary hypertension, heart failure, and respiratory symptoms.
3. Given the focus on cardiovascular and pulmonary conditions in the scenario, the tool most aligned with assessing Mean Arterial Pressure in a clinical context is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator from the Tool List.
4. The MAP calculator directly calculates the Mean Arterial Pressure based on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which is crucial in assessing tissue perfusion and blood flow, especially in scenarios like heart failure and pulmonary complications.
5. Therefore, based on the relevance of Mean Arterial Pressure assessment to the presented case and the specific keyword in the User Demand, the most suitable tool choice is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator.

2025-08-19 20:21:23,892 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333

Parameter List：
{
    "systolic_bp": {"Value": 145, "Unit": "mmHg"},
    "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 85, "Unit": "mmHg"}
}

Step By Step Analysis:
For the parameter 'systolic_bp':
Function Docstring: Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
Parameter List: Value = 145 mmHg

For the parameter 'diastolic_bp':
Function Docstring: Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
Parameter List: Value = 85 mmHg

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use the same unit of mmHg."
}
