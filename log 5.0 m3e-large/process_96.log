2025-08-19 20:39:17,049 - INFO - 1. User Demand Analysis:
The user demand is asking for a tool that assesses cardiac risk in pre-operative patients. This aligns with the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" tool from the Tool List. This tool specifically calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to evaluate the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing surgery.

2. Task Scenario Analysis:
In the provided scenario, the patient presents with acute drug poisoning (rat poison), stab wounds to the right anterior chest and abdomen, liver contusion laceration, abdominal effusion, and hemorrhagic anemia. These clinical manifestations indicate possible liver function impairment leading to liver contusion laceration and perihepatic hematoma. Additionally, abdominal effusion suggests potential organ damage or inflammatory response in the abdomen. Hemorrhagic anemia is due to significant blood loss from the self-inflicted stab wounds. The inclusion of blood transfusions in the treatment plan further confirms the presence of significant blood loss. Considering the overall condition, it is likely that liver, abdominal organ function, and blood function may be affected.

Based on the Task Scenario and the User Demand, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-19 20:39:24,246 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
