}
``` 

Step-By-Step Analysis:
1. User Demand: The demand asks for a risk assessment tool used to predict the risk of major cardiac adverse events within 6 weeks.
2. Task Scenario Analysis: The scenario describes a patient with indications of severe heart dysfunction, coronary artery stenosis, ischemic heart disease history, and exacerbating factors such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) acute exacerbation. These factors point to a high-risk cardiac profile.
3. Tool Selection: The most suitable tool based on the demand and scenario is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events." This tool calculates the risk for acute coronary syndrome, including major cardiac events. The factors assessed in the scenario, such as history, risk factors, and presence of symptoms, align with the HEART score parameters for predicting cardiac events in patients presenting with chest pain.
4. Conclusion: Given the clinical presentation and the need for assessing the risk of major cardiac events in the patient, the HEART Score tool is the best choice for risk prediction and guiding further management strategies.

2025-08-19 20:19:18,891 - INFO - {{"Calculate the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories: History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level.

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

{{"history_score": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}}
The parameter meets the requirements as it is an integer value based on the patient's history assessment score. No unit conversion is necessary.

{{"ekg_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null}}
The parameter meets the requirements as it is an integer value based on the EKG findings score. No unit conversion is necessary.

{{"age_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null}}
The parameter meets the requirements as it is an integer value based on the patient's age score. No unit conversion is necessary.

{{"risk_factors_score": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}}
The parameter meets the requirements as it is an integer value based on the number of cardiovascular risk factors score. No unit conversion is necessary.

{{"troponin_score": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}}
The parameter meets the requirements as it is an integer value based on the initial troponin level score. No unit conversion is necessary.
