2025-08-19 20:27:05,633 - INFO - 1. User Demand: The user is asking for a tool used to calculate a patient's estimated due date (预产期).

2. Task Scenario Analysis:
   - The task scenario describes a patient with difficult-to-control diabetes mellitus complicating pregnancy, fungal vaginitis, and oligohydramnios. These conditions can impact insulin secretion/utilization, affect fetal growth and development, cause discomfort in the reproductive tract, and increase preterm birth risk.

3. Matching Tool Selection:
   - The tool that aligns best with the User Demand for calculating the estimated due date in pregnancy is the "Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator" from the provided list.
   
4. Choice Justification:
   - The "Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator" is specifically designed to estimate the due date based on the last menstrual period and cycle length, which directly addresses the core keyword of "预产期" in the User Demand.
   - Given the scenario of a patient with pregnancy-related complications, accurate estimation of the due date is essential for managing the pregnancy timeline effectively and planning appropriate medical care.
   
5. Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_tool_name": "Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator"
}
```

2025-08-19 20:27:08,722 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

    This function uses a standard method recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),
    which considers the first trimester ultrasound measurements to be the most accurate method to establish gestational age.

    Parameters:
    - cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
                           If cycle_length is more than 28, the difference is added to the 40-week period.
    - last_menstrual_period (str): The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

    Returns:
    - str: The estimated due date in the format 'Day, Month DD, YYYY'.

    Usage:
    The function is intended for use by healthcare providers to estimate due dates for pregnant patients,
    which can help in managing pregnancy timelines effectively and in planning medical care accordingly.

    Example:
    'Monday, Oct 16, 2023'
}}

Parameter List：
{{{"cycle_length": {"Value": 28, "Unit": "days"}, "last_menstrual_period": {"Value": "2018/03/15", "Unit": null}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
Parameter: cycle_length
Function Docstring: 
- The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.

Parameter List:
- Value: 28
- Unit: days

Summary:
The units match the requirements specified in the Function Docstring.

Parameter: last_menstrual_period
Function Docstring: 
- The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

Parameter List:
- Value: "2018/03/15"
- Unit: null

Summary:
The value is in the correct format as specified in the Function Docstring.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters are consistent with the expected formats."
