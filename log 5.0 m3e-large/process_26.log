2. Relevant Tool in the Tool List: "ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications"
3. Analysis:
   - The tool chosen, ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications, is designed to predict the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in surgical patients based on various parameters.
   - While the tool is not directly related to hepatitic conditions or liver fibrosis, there is no tool in the provided list that directly addresses drug-induced liver injury or its sequela, liver fibrosis.
   - Given the absence of a specific tool for assessing drug-induced liver injury-induced liver fibrosis, we can select a tool that involves assessment based on scoring systems that are commonly used in clinical practice to predict outcomes.
   - In this case, the ARISCAT Score, although not a direct match, can be a suitable choice as it involves scoring parameters to predict a specific outcome (in this case, postoperative pulmonary complications) based on clinical indicators. This practice is analogous to assessing the severity/fibrosis in a hepatitic context based on clinical parameters.

{{Calculate the ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications.
    This score helps predict the risk of pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery under general, neuraxial, or regional anesthesia.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    spo2 (int): Preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) percentage.
    respiratory_infection (int): Indicates the presence of respiratory infection in the last month. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
    anemia (int): Indicates preoperative anemia (Hgb ≤10 g/dL). 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
    surgical_incision (int): Type of surgical incision. 0 for 'Peripheral', 1 for 'Upper abdominal', 2 for 'Intrathoracic'.
    surgery_duration (int): Duration of the surgery in hours.
    emergency (int): Indicates if the procedure was an emergency. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.

Step By Step Analysis:

1. Parameter: age
Function Docstring: Patient's age in years.
Parameter List: Value=36, Unit=岁
Comparison: Units are not consistent. Age should be in "years" but the given value is in "岁".
Decision: toolcall
Supplementary Information: The age is 36岁. The age needs to be converted from years to 岁.

2. Parameter: spo2 (not present in the Parameter List)
Function Docstring: Preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) percentage.
Comparison: Parameter is missing in the Parameter List.
Decision: toolcall
Supplementary Information: The spo2 is missing in the Parameter List. It needs to be added with the appropriate value and unit.

2025-08-19 20:07:42,387 - INFO - 1. The core medical intent in the user demand is the conversion of age from years to a different unit of age, specifically in this case, from years to "岁." This does not directly align with disease severity or any specific medical condition, so we need to find a tool that can convert age units.

2. Among the tools provided in the tool list, none of them are explicitly related to age conversion. However, the tool "Human Growth Hormone (hGH), 人类生长激素(hGH)" involves the conversion of values from one unit to another, which is the essence of what we need to do in this case, albeit for a different parameter.

3. The "Human Growth Hormone (hGH)" tool can work for this task by using the conversion functionality it offers. We can repurpose this tool to convert the age value from years (input_unit) to "岁" (target_unit).

Therefore, based on the analysis above, the most suitable tool from the Tool List for converting age from years to "岁" is "Human Growth Hormone (hGH)."
