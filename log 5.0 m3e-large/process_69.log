{{Calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

    This function uses a standard method recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),
    which considers the first trimester ultrasound measurements to be the most accurate method to establish gestational age.

    Parameters:
    - cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
                           If cycle_length is more than 28, the difference is added to the 40-week period.
    - last_menstrual_period (str): The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

    Returns:
    - str: The estimated due date in the format 'Day, Month DD, YYYY'.

    Usage:
    The function is intended for use by healthcare providers to estimate due dates for pregnant patients,
    which can help in managing pregnancy timelines effectively and in planning medical care accordingly.

    Example:
    'Monday, Oct 16, 2023'
}}

Parameter List：
{{{"cycle_length": {"Value": 28, "Unit": "days"}, "last_menstrual_period": {"Value": "2019/07/12", "Unit": null}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
1. Parameter 'cycle_length':
   Function Docstring Unit: days
   Parameter List Unit: days
   Decision: calculate

2. Parameter 'last_menstrual_period':

2025-08-19 20:26:40,412 - INFO - Based on the User Demand provided, which includes information about the last menstrual period, it is clear that the demand is related to tracking menstrual cycles or pregnancy. This indicates a focus on hormonal markers associated with the menstrual cycle, ovulation, and pregnancy.

Looking at the Tool List, the tool that closely aligns with the user demand is "Progesterone, 黄体酮." Progesterone is a hormone that plays a crucial role in the menstrual cycle, particularly in the second half of the cycle and during pregnancy. It is involved in preparing the uterus for implantation of a fertilized egg and supporting early pregnancy.

Therefore, based on the alignment with the core medical intent and domain keyword relevance to menstrual cycles and pregnancy, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List is "Progesterone, 黄体酮."
