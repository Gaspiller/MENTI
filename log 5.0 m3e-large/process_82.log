2025-08-19 20:32:52,935 - INFO - 1. Given the User Demand mentioning the evaluation of cardiac risk before uterine fibroid resection surgery, we need to select a tool from the Tool List that specifically assesses cardiac risk in the preoperative setting.

2. Among the tools listed, the most suitable tool for assessing cardiac risk preoperatively in the context of uterine fibroid resection surgery is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

3. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is designed to evaluate the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It considers specific risk factors related to cardiac health to provide an estimate of the patient's cardiac risk.

4. In the provided case scenario, where the patient has uterine fibroids, irregular endometrial growth, and a history of previous pacemaker implantation, the assessment of cardiac risk before surgery becomes crucial due to potential implications on cardiac function.

5. The presence of a pacemaker and the need for uterine fibroid resection surgery highlight the importance of evaluating the patient's cardiac risk factors, which align with the purpose of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index tool.

6. Therefore, based on the core medical intent of assessing cardiac risk preoperatively in a patient with uterine fibroids and a pacemaker, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-19 20:33:00,245 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
