2025-08-19 19:58:00,705 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess liver function and disease severity in patients with liver cirrhosis.
2. In the provided Task Scenario, the patient is diagnosed with liver cirrhosis, splenomegaly, hyperthyroidism, hyperthyroid heart disease, decompensated liver cirrhosis, and class IV heart function among other conditions.
3. The key abnormal findings include decompensated liver cirrhosis with elevated total bilirubin (TBil) of 597.0μmol/L, jaundice, ascites, hepatosplenomegaly, and reduced albumin (Alb) levels.
4. Additional findings show significant hyperthyroidism with low thyrotropin (TSH), elevated free triiodothyronine (FT3) and free thyroxine (FT4), abnormal thyroid associated antibodies, thyroid volume enlargement, and cardiac abnormalities consistent with heart failure.
5. Considering the severity of the liver disease, the need to evaluate liver function and disease severity is crucial in the management of this complex patient.
6. The tool from the provided list that is designed to assess liver function and disease severity, especially in the presence of liver cirrhosis, is the "Child-Pugh Score."
7. The Child-Pugh Score takes into account parameters such as ascites, encephalopathy, bilirubin levels, albumin levels, and prothrombin time/international normalized ratio (INR) to assess the severity of liver disease and predict mortality in patients with cirrhosis.
Based on the alignment with the core keywords in the User Demand and the detailed analysis of the patient's condition in the Task Scenario, the most suitable tool to choose is the "Child-Pugh Score."
