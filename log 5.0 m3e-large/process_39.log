2025-08-19 20:13:45,816 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess the severity of patient consciousness and mental status, which aligns with the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) from the tool list.
2. The Task Scenario describes a 66-year-old male patient presenting with altered consciousness, coma, inability to open eyes, and impaired motor responses, which are key elements assessed by the GCS.
3. The GCS evaluates eye response, verbal response, and motor response to determine the level of consciousness in patients, making it suitable for assessing the severity of the patient's coma and altered mental status in this scenario.
4. Therefore, based on the User Demand and the details provided in the Task Scenario, the most appropriate tool to choose is the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS).

2025-08-19 20:13:53,245 - INFO - {{"Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed."}}
