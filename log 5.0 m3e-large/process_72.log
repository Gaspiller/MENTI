2025-08-19 20:28:01,597 - INFO - 1. The User Demand explicitly asks for a tool to evaluate the severity of pneumonia in the patient.
2. The Task Scenario describes a 2-year-old female patient with symptoms suggestive of a respiratory infection and underlying neutropenia, both of which increase susceptibility to severe infections like pneumonia.
3. Given the focus on assessing pneumonia severity in a patient with respiratory symptoms and immune compromise, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the "CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity".
4. The CURB-65 Score is designed specifically to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia, which aligns perfectly with the User Demand for evaluating pneumonia severity in this case.
5. This tool considers factors such as confusion, respiratory rate, age, and other clinical parameters to determine the severity of pneumonia and guide treatment decisions in such cases.
6. Therefore, based on the core keywords and context provided in the User Demand and Task Scenario, the most appropriate tool to choose is the "CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity".

{{Calculate the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.

The CURB-65 calculator can be used in the emergency department setting to risk stratify a patient’s community acquired pneumonia.
It includes points for confusion, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age.

Parameters:
confusion (int): Confusion status, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes.
bun (int): Blood urea nitrogen status, where 0 = BUN ≤ 19 mg/dL (≤ 7 mmol/L urea) and 1 = BUN > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L urea).
respiratory_rate (int): Respiratory rate status, where 0 = < 30 breaths/min and 1 = ≥ 30 breaths/min.
blood_pressure (int): Blood pressure status, where 0 = Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg, and 1 = Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg.
age (int): Age status, where 0 = < 65 years and 1 = ≥ 65 years.

Returns:
int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

Usage:
This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.

Example:
>>> curb_65_score(1, 1, 1, 0, 1)
4
