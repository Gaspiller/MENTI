2025-08-19 20:32:22,047 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically mentions "评估患者在进行利凡诺穿刺引产术前的心脏风险" which translates to "assessing the patient's cardiac risk before undergoing amniocentesis-induced abortion." This indicates a need to evaluate the patient's cardiac risk before a medical procedure involving amniocentesis-induced abortion.

2. Among the provided tools in the Tool List, the most relevant tool for assessing preoperative cardiac risk in a patient undergoing a medical procedure like amniocentesis-induced abortion would be the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

3. The "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It considers specific risk factors related to cardiac health, making it suitable for evaluating cardiac risk in a preoperative context.

4. Considering the nature of the medical procedure mentioned in the User Demand and the need to evaluate cardiac risk in a surgical setting, the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" aligns closely with the core keywords and intent of the User Demand.

2025-08-19 20:32:33,067 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
