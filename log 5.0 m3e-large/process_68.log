2025-08-19 20:26:04,067 - INFO - Based on the User Demand for a pregnancy due dates calculator and the Task Scenario provided, the key focus is on estimating the due date for a pregnancy, which is crucial for managing pregnancy timelines effectively. Given the context of a pregnant patient with complications such as premature rupture of membranes and nuchal cord complication (cord around the neck), the need for accurate due date estimation becomes even more critical for monitoring the pregnancy's progress and potential risks to both the mother and the fetus.

Considering the importance of estimating the due date accurately in such a scenario, the most suitable tool from the provided list would be the **Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator**. This tool is specifically designed to calculate the estimated due date for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length. By accurately determining the estimated due date, healthcare providers can better manage the pregnancy, monitor any complications that may arise, and plan appropriate medical care for both the mother and the fetus.

Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List is:

2025-08-19 20:26:06,652 - INFO - {{Function Docstring:
Calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

This function uses a standard method recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),
which considers the first trimester ultrasound measurements to be the most accurate method to establish gestational age.

Parameters:
- cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
                       If cycle_length is more than 28, the difference is added to the 40-week period.
- last_menstrual_period (str): The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

Returns:
- str: The estimated due date in the format 'Day, Month DD, YYYY'.

Usage:
The function is intended for use by healthcare providers to estimate due dates for pregnant patients,
which can help in managing pregnancy timelines effectively and in planning medical care accordingly.

Example:
'Monday, Oct 16, 2023'
