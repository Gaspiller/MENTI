2025-08-19 20:01:28,135 - INFO - 1. The core keyword in the User Demand is "肾小球滤过率" (glomerular filtration rate), which directly corresponds to the CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) tool from the Tool List.

2. The Task Scenario mentions acute kidney failure due to a urinary system infection caused by a right kidney stone. The laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels, reflecting kidney dysfunction. Given the patient's history of type 2 diabetes, which is known to impact kidney function, the CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) tool becomes highly relevant for estimating the patient's GFR.

3. Considering the alignment rules, the choice of the CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) tool is justified by both the primary keyword in the User Demand and the patient's specific clinical scenario described in the Task Scenario.

2025-08-19 20:01:34,069 - INFO - {{"Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

Parameters:
- serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
- age (int): The age of the patient in years.
- gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

Returns:
- float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

Usage:
To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

Note:
- Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
- Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass."}}
Parameter List：
{{{"serum_creatinine": {"Value": 7.47, "Unit": "mg/dL"}, "age": {"Value": 66, "Unit": "years"}, "gender": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
For parameter 'serum_creatinine':
- The Function Docstring requires the serum creatinine level in mg/dL.
- The given value for serum_creatinine is 7.47 mg/dL. This complies with the requirements in the Function Docstring.

For parameter 'age':
- The Function Docstring requires the age of the patient in years.
- The given value for age is 66 years. This complies with the requirements in the Function Docstring.

For parameter 'gender':
- The Function Docstring requires the gender of the patient using 0 for male and 1 for female.
- The given value for gender is 0, which corresponds to male as per the requirements in the Function Docstring.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use indices to specify units."
