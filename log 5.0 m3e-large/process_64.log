2025-08-19 20:24:22,831 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to evaluate a patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).
2. The Task Scenario mentions a patient with conditions related to biliary tract obstruction and infection, presenting with symptoms such as cholangitis, sepsis, and localized peritonitis. The treatment involves managing the infection and symptoms.
3. Given the medical context of the demand and scenario, the key focus is on assessing the patient's hemodynamic status, particularly the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).
4. The MAP is a crucial indicator used to evaluate tissue perfusion and blood flow, which is essential in cases of sepsis, shock, and critically ill patients.
5. Based on the tool list, the most suitable tool for the provided demand and scenario is "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator.
6. The calculation of MAP involves the systolic and diastolic blood pressure parameters, which are essential for monitoring hemodynamic stability in this clinical context.

2025-08-19 20:24:25,704 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies. The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.

Parameters:
systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.

Returns:
float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.

Example:
>>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
93.33333333333333

Parameter List:
{
    "systolic_bp": {"Value": 85, "Unit": "mmHg"},
    "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 63, "Unit": "mmHg"}
}
Step By Step Analysis:
1. systolic_bp:
- Function Docstring requires systolic_bp in mmHg.
- Parameter List has systolic_bp as 85 mmHg, which complies with the requirement.
2. diastolic_bp:
- Function Docstring requires diastolic_bp in mmHg.
- Parameter List has diastolic_bp as 63 mmHg, which complies with the requirement.
Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters are already in mmHg."
