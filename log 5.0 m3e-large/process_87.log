2025-08-19 20:35:07,391 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is explicitly asking for a tool used to assess the risk of cardiac complications after non-cardiac surgery.
   
2. The available tools in the Tool List that relate to cardiac risk assessment are "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" and "Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)."

3. The tool "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" specifically calculates the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery based on specific risk factors related to cardiac health.

4. Considering the patient's case involves a history of coronary heart disease, which is directly related to cardiac health, the most suitable tool to assess the risk of cardiac complications in this scenario would be the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

Therefore, the most appropriate tool for this scenario is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-19 20:35:16,678 - INFO - {{"Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.

Step By Step Analysis:

{{"elevated_risk_surgery" Parameter Docstring:
bool: True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.}}
Comparison: The "elevated_risk_surgery" parameter in the Parameter List has a value of false, which aligns with the Docstring's requirement of a boolean value. No unit conversion is necessary.

{{"history_of_ischemic_heart_disease" Parameter Docstring:
bool: True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.}}
Comparison: The "history_of_ischemic_heart_disease" parameter in the Parameter List has a value of true, which aligns with the Docstring's requirement of a boolean value. No unit conversion is necessary.

{{"history_of_congestive_heart_failure" Parameter Docstring:
bool: True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.}}
Comparison: The "history_of_congestive_heart_failure" parameter in the Parameter List has a value of false, which aligns with the Docstring's requirement of a boolean value. No unit conversion is necessary.

{{"history_of_cerebrovascular_disease" Parameter Docstring:
bool: True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.}}
Comparison: The "history_of_cerebrovascular_disease" parameter in the Parameter List has a value of false, which aligns with the Docstring's requirement of a boolean value. No unit conversion is necessary.

{{"preop_treatment_with_insulin" Parameter Docstring:
bool: True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.}}
Comparison: The "preop_treatment_with_insulin" parameter in the Parameter List has a value of false, which aligns with the Docstring's requirement of a boolean value. No unit conversion is necessary.

{{"preop_creatinine_above_threshold" Parameter Docstring:
bool: True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.}}
Comparison: The "preop_creatinine_above_threshold" parameter in the Parameter List has a value of false, which aligns with the Docstring's requirement of a boolean value. No unit conversion is necessary.
