2025-08-19 20:25:10,760 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to evaluate the severity of depression in patients.
2. Among the tools listed in the Tool List, the tool that directly assesses and quantifies the severity of depression symptoms is the "PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)".
3. The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale designed to diagnose depression and monitor the severity of depressive symptoms based on the DSM criteria.
4. The parameters in the PHQ-9 include various symptoms such as interest/pleasure, feeling down, sleep disturbances, fatigue, appetite changes, self-worth, concentration issues, activity levels, and suicidal thoughts.
5. The PHQ-9 sums the scores of these symptoms to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating more severe depression.
6. Given the detailed symptoms provided in the Task Scenario aligning with the diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder and the need to assess the severity of depression, the PHQ-9 is the most suitable tool to use in this case.

2025-08-19 20:25:18,468 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.
