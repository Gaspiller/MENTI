2025-08-19 20:18:15,517 - INFO - 1. User Demand: The user is asking which tool is used to predict the risk of major cardiac events in patients within 6 weeks.
2. Task Scenario: The patient has been diagnosed with third-degree atrioventricular block, which is a condition indicating abnormal function in the cardiac conduction system.
3. Analysis:
   - Given the focus on predicting the risk of major cardiac events, the most suitable tool from the list would be the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events." This tool specifically calculates the risk of acute coronary syndrome in patients presenting with chest pain.
   - The task scenario of a patient having a cardiac conduction system abnormality aligns with the need to assess the risk of major cardiac events, making the HEART Score an appropriate choice.
4. Choice:
   - The most suitable tool based on the user demand and task scenario is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-19 20:18:24,055 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
