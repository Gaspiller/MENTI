2025-08-19 20:20:31,956 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool that assesses the risk of major cardiac events in a patient over the next 6 weeks.
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with acute non-ST elevation inferior wall myocardial infarction, third-degree atrioventricular block, and type 2 diabetes, indicating potential cardiac conduction abnormalities, rhythm disturbances, and increased cardiovascular risk factors.
3. Considering the keywords "assessing risk of major cardiac events" and the patient's complex cardiac condition, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events".
4. The HEART Score considers factors like history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels to risk-stratify patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome.
5. Given the patient's profile and the need to evaluate the risk of major cardiac events, the HEART Score aligns well with the core medical intent and the patient's clinical presentation.

2025-08-19 20:20:41,553 - INFO - {{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

Step By Step Analysis:
1. history_score:
    Function Docstring Unit: None
    Parameter List Unit: None
    Analysis: The unit for history_score in the Parameter List is consistent with the Function Docstring.
2. ekg_score:
    Function Docstring Unit: None
    Parameter List Unit: None
    Analysis: The unit for ekg_score in the Parameter List is consistent with the Function Docstring.
3. age_score:
    Function Docstring Unit: None
    Parameter List Unit: None
    Analysis: The unit for age_score in the Parameter List is consistent with the Function Docstring.
4. risk_factors_score:
    Function Docstring Unit: None
    Parameter List Unit: None
    Analysis: The unit for risk_factors_score in the Parameter List is consistent with the Function Docstring.
5. troponin_score:
    Function Docstring Unit: None
    Parameter List Unit: None
    Analysis: The unit for troponin_score in the Parameter List is consistent with the Function Docstring.
