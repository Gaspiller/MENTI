2025-08-19 20:09:47,812 - INFO - Based on the User Demand and Task Scenario, we need to choose a tool from the Tool List that is used to assess the 10-year risk of hard coronary heart disease in patients. The tool that aligns with this requirement is the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease."

The Framingham Risk Score is specifically designed to calculate the risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease in patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease history. It takes into account parameters such as age, sex, smoking status, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and medication use to estimate the risk of coronary heart disease over a 10-year period.

Given that the Task Scenario mentions the history of coronary artery atherosclerosis and the risk of atherosclerotic heart disease, the Framingham Risk Score is the most suitable tool to assess the 10-year risk of hard coronary heart disease for the patient described in the scenario.

Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List is:
```json
{
    "chosen_tool_name": "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease"
}
```

{{Calculate the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease in patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease history, diabetes, or intermittent claudication.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
    - sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
    - total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    Returns:
    float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.
