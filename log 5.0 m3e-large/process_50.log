2025-08-19 20:18:43,649 - INFO - Based on the User Demand for predicting the risk of major cardiac events in patients after receiving coronary angiography and left heart catheterization, and considering the patient's history of hypertension, acute coronary syndrome symptoms, and the need for further diagnosis and treatment due to an unclear etiology, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

1. The HEART Score is specifically designed to risk-stratify emergency department patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which aligns perfectly with the user's demand for assessing the risk of major cardiac events post-angiography and catheterization.
2. The components of the HEART Score, including history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels, correspond well with the patient's history of hypertension, symptoms of acute coronary syndrome, and the need for further diagnosis to identify any other chronic conditions or unknown syndromes.
3. By calculating the HEART Score, healthcare providers can guide further management of chest pain patients in the emergency setting, which is crucial in the described scenario where the patient's condition requires further evaluation and treatment.
4. The tool's ability to categorize risk into low, moderate, and high-risk groups will assist in determining the appropriate course of action for the patient with respect to the presence of coronary artery disease and potential cardiac complications.

Therefore, the most suitable tool to address the User Demand is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-19 20:18:53,459 - INFO - {{"Calculate the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

Step By Step Analysis:

For history_score:
Function Docstring specifies that it is an 'int' representing a score, which has no specific unit mentioned. The Parameter List matches this requirement as it has a Value provided without any unit. Hence, it complies with the Function Docstring.

For ekg_score:
Function Docstring specifies that it is an 'int' representing a score, which has no specific unit mentioned. The Parameter List matches this requirement as it has a Value provided without any unit. Hence, it complies with the Function Docstring.

For age_score:
Function Docstring specifies that it is an 'int' representing a score, which has no specific unit mentioned. The Parameter List matches this requirement as it has a Value provided without any unit. Hence, it complies with the Function Docstring.

For risk_factors_score:
Function Docstring specifies that it is an 'int' representing a score, which has no specific unit mentioned. The Parameter List matches this requirement as it has a Value provided without any unit. Hence, it complies with the Function Docstring.

For troponin_score:
Function Docstring specifies that it is an 'int' representing a score, which has no specific unit mentioned. The Parameter List matches this requirement as it has a Value provided without any unit. Hence, it complies with the Function Docstring.
