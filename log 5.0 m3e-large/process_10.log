2. From the provided Tool List, the tool that directly aligns with the User Demand for assessing liver cirrhosis severity is "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis."
3. The "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis" is designed to estimate the level of liver fibrosis, which is crucial in assessing the severity of liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver diseases.
4. Considering the patient's case scenario mentioning severe liver disease, liver cirrhosis, and complications such as ascites and jaundice, the FIB-4 Index would be the most suitable tool to evaluate the severity of liver fibrosis in this context.

"Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

    Parameters:
        age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.
        ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.
        platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).
        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.
