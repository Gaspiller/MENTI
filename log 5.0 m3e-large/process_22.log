2025-08-19 20:05:04,685 - INFO - 1. User Demand Analysis:
   The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to assess the severity of pneumonia in patients. This aligns with tools in the Tool List such as the "CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity" and "PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP" which are explicitly designed for evaluating pneumonia severity.

2. Task Scenario Analysis:
   The Task Scenario describes a patient presenting with inflammatory changes in the lung, pleural thickening, and fluid accumulation, indicative of a pulmonary infection, likely pneumonia. The provided patient data includes parameters that can be used in tools like the CURB-65 or PSI/PORT scores, such as respiratory rate and BUN level, which are relevant for assessing pneumonia severity.

3. Matching Analysis:
   Given that the user's case involves a pulmonary infection suggestive of pneumonia, and the primary objective is to assess the severity of this condition, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the "CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity" or the "PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP". Both tools are designed to assess pneumonia severity in patients and are directly applicable to the presented scenario.

Based on the alignment with the User Demand and Task Scenario, the most appropriate tool to choose is:

2025-08-19 20:05:10,350 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.

The CURB-65 calculator can be used in the emergency department setting to risk stratify a patient’s community acquired pneumonia.
It includes points for confusion, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age.

Parameters:
confusion (int): Confusion status, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes.
bun (int): Blood urea nitrogen status, where 0 = BUN ≤ 19 mg/dL (≤ 7 mmol/L urea) and 1 = BUN > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L urea).
respiratory_rate (int): Respiratory rate status, where 0 = < 30 breaths/min and 1 = ≥ 30 breaths/min.
blood_pressure (int): Blood pressure status, where 0 = Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg, and 1 = Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg.
age (int): Age status, where 0 = < 65 years and 1 = ≥ 65 years.

Returns:
int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

Usage:
This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.

Example:
>>> curb_65_score(1, 1, 1, 0, 1)
4

4. Parameter: blood_pressure
Function Docstring Information:
- Type: int
- Values: 0 = Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg, 1 = Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg

Parameter List Information:
- Value: 0

Conclusion:
The parameter "blood_pressure" complies with the function docstring requirements.

5. Parameter: age
Function Docstring Information:
