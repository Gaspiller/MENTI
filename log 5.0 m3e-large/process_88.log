2025-08-19 20:35:34,091 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifies the need for a tool to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in a patient undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
2. From the Tool List, the most suitable tool for this scenario is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
3. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is specifically designed to assess cardiac risk in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery.
4. This tool considers various risk factors such as history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and cerebrovascular disease, which align with the cardiovascular function impairment in the patient with congenital heart disease.
5. By calculating the Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, healthcare providers can better stratify the patient's risk for major cardiac events post non-cardiac surgery.
6. Therefore, based on the alignment of keywords in the User Demand and the capabilities of the tool, the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" is the most appropriate choice.

2025-08-19 20:35:40,286 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
