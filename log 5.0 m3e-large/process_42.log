2025-08-19 20:15:04,117 - INFO - 1. The core keywords in the User Demand are "上消化道出血" (upper gastrointestinal bleeding) and "风险评估" (risk assessment), indicating the need for a tool that assesses the risk in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
   
2. Among the tools provided in the list, the most suitable tool for assessing the risk and stratification in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding is the "Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)".

3. The Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score is specifically designed to calculate the severity and risk of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in adult patients needing hospital admission due to this condition.

4. The Task Scenario mentions a patient diagnosed with a duodenal bulb ulcer and bleeding, resulting in anemia. The patient underwent endoscopic hemostasis and showed improvement after treatment. The continued drop in red blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, and hematocrit, along with positive fecal occult blood test, indicates significant upper gastrointestinal bleeding leading to anemia.

5. Given that the patient's treatment included hemostasis and medication, which effectively stopped the melena, assessing the risk with the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score can aid in further monitoring and treatment to restore the patient's gastrointestinal function and anemia condition.

The chosen tool based on the analysis is the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS).

{{Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.
    
    Parameters:
    - hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
    - bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

    Returns:
    - int: Glasgow-Blatchford Score, ranging from 0 to 23.

    This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.
