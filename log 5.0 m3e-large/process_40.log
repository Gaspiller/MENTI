2025-08-19 20:14:11,528 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess the level of consciousness and neurological function in patients. This aligns with the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) tool from the provided Tool List.
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with sudden consciousness disorders attributed to a right basal ganglia hemorrhage with hematoma formation extending into the ventricular system, resulting in impaired neurological function. The symptoms mentioned in the scenario, including loss of light reflex, respiratory distress, dilated pupils, and soft neck, are indicative of severe neurological impairment, which corresponds to the evaluation criteria of the GCS tool.
3. The GCS tool evaluates three key responses - eye, verbal, and motor responses - to assess the level of consciousness and neurological function in patients with coma or acute neurological conditions, precisely matching the requirements of the User Demand and the scenario.
4. Therefore, based on the alignment with the core keywords, the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) from the Tool List is the most appropriate choice for this scenario.

2025-08-19 20:14:20,097 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.}}
Parameter List：{{{"eye_response": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, "verbal_response": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, "motor_response": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:

1. Parameter: eye_response
Function Docstring Requirement: The eye_response should be a score (int) or 'NT' (not testable).
Parameter List Information: Value is 1, no Unit provided.

Comparison:
- The Value 1 given in the parameter list is consistent with the int requirement in the Function Docstring.

2. Parameter: verbal_response
Function Docstring Requirement: The verbal_response should be a score (int) or 'NT' (not testable).
Parameter List Information: Value is 1, no Unit provided.

Comparison:
- The Value 1 given in the parameter list is consistent with the int requirement in the Function Docstring.

3. Parameter: motor_response
Function Docstring Requirement: The motor_response should be a score (int) or 'NT' (not testable).
Parameter List Information: Value is 2, no Unit provided.

Comparison:
- The Value 2 given in the parameter list is consistent with the int requirement in the Function Docstring.

Final Answer:

{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters are already in the correct format."
