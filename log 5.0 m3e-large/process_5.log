2025-08-19 19:56:39,221 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess the stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.
2. The relevant tool from the Tool List for this scenario is the "CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk."
3. The CHA2DS2-VASc Score is specifically designed to estimate the risk of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, aligning perfectly with the core keywords "atrial fibrillation" and "stroke risk."
4. The tool takes into account factors like age, gender, history of heart failure, hypertension, diabetes, stroke or TIA, and vascular disease, all of which are relevant in assessing stroke risk in atrial fibrillation patients.
5. Given the patient's case of atrial fibrillation and the need to evaluate stroke risk in this context, the CHA2DS2-VASc Score is the most suitable tool to use.
6. Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List based on the User Demand and Task Scenario is the "CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk."

{{Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

Parameters:
- age (int): Age of the patient.
- sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
- history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
- history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
- history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
- history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
- history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

Returns:
- int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

Example:
>>> calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(75, 'female', True, True, True, True, True)

Parameter Listï¼š
{{{"age": {"Value": 89, "Unit": "years"}, "sex": {"Value": "female", "Unit": null}, "history_of_congestive_heart_failure": {"Value": true, "Unit": null}, "history_of_hypertension": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, "history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, "history_of_vascular_disease": {"Value": true, "Unit": null}, "history_of_diabetes": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
1. Parameter 'age':
   - Function Docstring specifies 'age' as an integer representing the age of the patient.
   - Parameter List provides 'age' as 89 years.
   - Both 'age' values are consistent with each other.
2. Parameter 'sex':
   - Function Docstring requires 'sex' as a string ('male' or 'female').
   - Parameter List provides 'sex' as 'female'.
   - Both 'sex' values are consistent with each other.
3. Parameter 'history_of_congestive_heart_failure':
   - Function Docstring indicates 'history_of_congestive_heart_failure' as a boolean parameter.
   - Parameter List provides 'history_of_congestive_heart_failure' as true (boolean).
   - Both 'history_of_congestive_heart_failure' values are consistent with each other.
4. Parameter 'history_of_hypertension':
   - Function Docstring specifies 'history_of_hypertension' as a boolean parameter.
   - Parameter List provides 'history_of_hypertension' as false (boolean).
   - Both 'history_of_hypertension' values are consistent with each other.
5. Parameter 'history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism':
   - Function Docstring requires 'history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism' as a boolean parameter.
   - Parameter List provides 'history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism' as false (boolean).
   - Both 'history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism' values are consistent with each other.
6. Parameter 'history_of_vascular_disease':
   - Function Docstring specifies 'history_of_vascular_disease' as a boolean parameter.
   - Parameter List provides 'history_of_vascular_disease' as true (boolean).
   - Both 'history_of_vascular_disease' values are consistent with each other.
7. Parameter 'history_of_diabetes':
   - Function Docstring requires 'history_of_diabetes' as a boolean parameter.
   - Parameter List provides 'history_of_diabetes' as false (boolean).
   - Both 'history_of_diabetes' values are consistent with each other.
