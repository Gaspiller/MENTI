2025-08-19 20:20:57,980 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to predict the risk of a patient experiencing major cardiac events within 6 weeks.
2. The Task Scenario mentions the patient's coronary artery atherosclerotic heart disease, which puts him at an increased risk of cardiovascular events.
3. From the Tool List, the most suitable tool for predicting the risk of major cardiac events in this patient scenario is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events".
4. The HEART Score is specifically designed to risk-stratify patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which aligns with the patient's condition and the need to predict potential cardiac events.
5. Choosing the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events" is the most relevant and appropriate tool in this context.

2025-08-19 20:21:02,695 - INFO - {{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
