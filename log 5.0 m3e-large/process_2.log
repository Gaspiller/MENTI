2025-08-19 19:54:58,135 - INFO - 1. User Demand: The user is asking for a scale to assess the risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) in surgical patients. This aligns with the tool "Wells' Criteria for DVT" from the Tool List, as it specifically evaluates the risk of Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT) which is a type of VTE.

2. Task Scenario Analysis: The patient's clinical diagnosis is non-purulent thrombosis in the intracranial venous sinuses, indicating a condition involving potential blood clot formation. The neurological symptoms such as headache, limb numbness, and facial numbness also suggest possible neurological impairment due to increased intracranial pressure. Treatment focusing on neurological support and metabolic regulation further supports the notion of neurological damage. Improvement in the patient's condition post-treatment also verifies the improvement in the degree of neurological impairment. The MRI findings of narrowing in the right venous sinus corroborate the impact of abnormal intracranial pressure on the nervous system. This indicates a likelihood of impairment in the patient's coordination and sensory functions.

Based on the analysis of the User Demand and Task Scenario, the most suitable tool to assess the risk of VTE in this surgical patient is the "Wells' Criteria for DVT."

2025-08-19 19:55:09,186 - INFO - {{"Calculate the Wells' Criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).

    This scale helps clinicians in outpatient and emergency settings to stratify patients' risk of DVT. A score below 2, coupled with a negative d-dimer test, allows clinicians to rule out DVT without the need for ultrasound imaging. This method balances the need for accurate diagnosis with the resource and time costs associated with more invasive tests.

    Parameters:
    active_cancer (bool): True if the patient has active cancer (treatment within last 6 months).
    bedridden_recently (bool): True if the patient was bedridden for more than 3 days recently or had major surgery within the last 12 weeks.
    calf_swelling (bool): True if the patient's calf swelling exceeds 3 cm compared to the other leg.
    collateral_veins (bool): True if collateral non-varicose superficial veins are present.
    entire_leg_swollen (bool): True if the entire leg is swollen.
    localized_tenderness (bool): True if there is localized tenderness along the deep venous system.
    pitting_edema (bool): True if there is pitting edema confined to the symptomatic leg.
    recent_immobilization (bool): True if the patient had paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities.
    previous_dvt (bool): True if the patient has a history of documented DVT.
    alternative_diagnosis (bool): True if an alternative diagnosis is as likely or more likely than DVT.

    Returns:
    int: Wells' score for DVT, where higher values indicate a higher probability of DVT.

    Usage:
    score = calculate_wells_criteria_dvt(True, False, True, True, False, True, True, False, True, False)}}

2. Since the demand is specifically focused on converting age from years to points, the tool that best matches this requirement from the Tool List is not explicitly mentioned. However, a tool such as the "APACHE II Score" or "PSI/PORT Score" could be suitable for converting clinical parameters including age into severity points for specific medical conditions.
3. Based on the provided tools and the core intent of converting age to points, the tool that aligns closely with this task is the "APACHE II Score" as it involves converting patient characteristics including age into a scoring system to assess disease severity and predict outcomes in critically ill patients.
4. Therefore, the chosen tool for this scenario is the "APACHE II Score".
