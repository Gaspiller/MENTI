2025-08-19 20:34:42,547 - INFO - 1. User Demand Analysis:
The user demand is asking for a tool that assesses the risk of cardiac complications in non-cardiac surgical patients postoperatively. This aligns with the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" tool in the provided list, as it specifically evaluates the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

2. Task Scenario Analysis:
The task scenario describes a patient with a primary presentation of a right inguinal hernia, along with additional findings of right ventricular developmental anomaly and incomplete right bundle branch block on ECG. These cardiac-related issues present a potential risk factor for cardiac complications in the context of non-cardiac surgery. Therefore, the scenario further supports the need for evaluating the patient's cardiac risk preoperatively, making the Revised Cardiac Risk Index applicable.

3. Conclusion:
Based on the alignment of the user demand for assessing cardiac risk in non-cardiac surgical patients and the cardiac-related findings in the task scenario, the most suitable tool from the list is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk".

2025-08-19 20:34:50,023 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.

Parameter List:
{
    "elevated_risk_surgery": {"Value": true, "Unit": null}, 
    "history_of_ischemic_heart_disease": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, 
    "history_of_congestive_heart_failure": {"Value": false, "Unit": null},
