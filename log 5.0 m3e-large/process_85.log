2025-08-19 20:34:10,693 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to assess the post-operative risk for patients undergoing surgery. This aligns with the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" from the provided Tool List.

2. The Task Scenario, while discussing the genetic disorder trisomy 21 (Down syndrome), does not mention any specific medical condition or severity assessment related to surgery. Therefore, we should prioritize the core demand of assessing pre-operative cardiac risk.

3. The "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" is explicitly designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It helps in risk stratification and informed decisions for preoperative and postoperative care.

Based on the analysis, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List for the User Demand is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-19 20:34:23,604 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
