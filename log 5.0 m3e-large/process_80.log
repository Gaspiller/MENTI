2025-08-19 20:31:55,714 - INFO - Based on the User Demand, which is asking for a tool to evaluate the postoperative cardiac risk in preoperative coronary heart disease patients, the most suitable tool from the provided list is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

1. The User Demand specifically mentions assessing postoperative heart risk in preoperative coronary heart disease patients, which aligns perfectly with the purpose of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index. This tool is designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It focuses on specific risk factors related to cardiac health, making it ideal for preoperative cardiac risk evaluation.

2. The symptoms and history presented in the Task Scenario, such as upper abdominal pain, a history of unstable angina and acute myocardial infarction, and current symptoms suggestive of acute coronary syndrome, all point towards cardiac issues. The patient's cardiac abnormalities and the need to evaluate postoperative cardiac risk make the Revised Cardiac Risk Index the most appropriate tool for this case.

Therefore, considering the core keywords in the User Demand and aligning them with the purpose of the tools in the provided list, the most suitable choice is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-19 20:32:04,968 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if preoperative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
