2025-08-19 20:33:48,201 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess the postoperative risk of a patient. The Task Scenario mentions the patient's history of heart stent placement and presents symptoms related to lung cancer and back pain. 

2. Considering the patient's history of heart stent placement and the need to assess postoperative risk, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

3. The "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. It considers factors such as elevated risk surgeries, history of ischemic heart disease, history of congestive heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, preoperative treatment with insulin, and preoperative creatinine levels.

4. Given the importance of assessing cardiac risk in a patient with a history of heart stent placement and presenting with symptoms indicative of potential cardiac involvement, the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" aligns well with the clinical context provided in the Task Scenario.

2025-08-19 20:33:54,248 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
