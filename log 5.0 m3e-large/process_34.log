2025-08-19 20:11:08,955 - INFO - 1. The user demand specifically asks for a tool that can assess the patient's risk of developing hard coronary heart disease within the next 10 years.
2. Given the detailed history provided in the task scenario, which includes factors such as chest pain consistent with stable angina, severe coronary artery disease, high cholesterol levels, and smoking, it is clear that the primary concern is the risk of developing coronary heart disease.
3. Looking at the available tools in the tool list, the most suitable tool for assessing the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease in this patient would be the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease."
4. The Framingham Risk Score specifically calculates the risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease in individuals aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease, considering risk factors like age, sex, smoking status, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure - all of which align with the patient's profile in the task scenario.
5. Therefore, based on the user demand for assessing the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease and the patient's history of coronary artery disease and associated risk factors, the most suitable tool is the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease."

{{"Calculate the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease in patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease history, diabetes, or intermittent claudication.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
    - sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
    - total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    Returns:
    float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.
