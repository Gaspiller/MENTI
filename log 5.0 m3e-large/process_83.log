2025-08-19 20:33:21,389 - INFO - 1. User Demand: The user demand is asking for a tool used to assess a patient's cardiac risk before high-risk surgery.
2. Task Scenario Analysis: The task scenario describes a case of a patient with marginal placenta previa complicated by bleeding. While this is primarily an obstetric issue, the mention of high-risk surgery hints at potential cardiac implications, especially in the context of bleeding and possible complications.
3. Analysis of Tool List:
    a) Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk: This tool specifically assesses the cardiac risk in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Given the cardiac implications in the scenario due to the potential for bleeding and the need for monitoring, this tool aligns with assessing cardiac risk before high-risk surgery.
    b) Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA): While this tool calculates cardiac risk percentage for surgery, its focus is more on acute cardiac events during surgery rather than pre-operative risk assessment.
    c) HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk: Although bleeding risk is a concern in the scenario, the primary focus is on cardiac risk assessment before surgery.
    d) Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis: Not directly related to assessing cardiac risk before high-risk surgery.
    e) Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism: Not relevant to the assessment of cardiac risk before surgery.
    f) Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005): Focuses on assessing the risk of venous thromboembolism in surgical patients, not cardiac risk specifically.
    g) Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia: Addresses calcium correction in patients with hypoalbuminemia, not directly related to cardiac risk assessment.
    h) ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications: Primarily for predicting postoperative pulmonary complications, not cardiac risk assessment.
    i) Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS): Evaluates the level of consciousness and not relevant to cardiac risk assessment.
    j) Anion Gap: Calculates the anion gap and is unrelated to assessing cardiac risk.

Based on the analysis, the most suitable tool from the list for assessing a patient's cardiac risk before high-risk surgery in the given scenario is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-19 20:33:30,852 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
