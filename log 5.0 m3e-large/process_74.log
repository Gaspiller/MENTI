2025-08-19 20:29:02,817 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess the severity of pneumonia in patients.
2. The provided Task Scenario mentions lung infection foci, possible pulmonary edema, and pleural effusion, indicating a respiratory infection and potential pneumonia.
3. Given the focus on pneumonia severity assessment in the Task Scenario, the most relevant tool from the Tool List would be the "CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity."
4. The CURB-65 Score is specifically designed to assess the severity of community-acquired pneumonia and helps in risk stratification of patients with pneumonia.
5. The parameters in the CURB-65 Score align well with the symptoms and conditions mentioned in the Task Scenario that indicate pneumonia severity.
6. Based on the strong correlation between the Task Scenario and the purpose of the CURB-65 Score, it is the most suitable tool to choose in this context.

{{"Calculate the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.

The CURB-65 calculator can be used in the emergency department setting to risk stratify a patient’s community acquired pneumonia.
It includes points for confusion, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age.

Parameters:
confusion (int): Confusion status, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes.
bun (int): Blood urea nitrogen status, where 0 = BUN ≤ 19 mg/dL (≤ 7 mmol/L urea) and 1 = BUN > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L urea).
respiratory_rate (int): Respiratory rate status, where 0 = < 30 breaths/min and 1 = ≥ 30 breaths/min.
blood_pressure (int): Blood pressure status, where 0 = Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg, and 1 = Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg.
age (int): Age status, where 0 = < 65 years and 1 = ≥ 65 years.

Returns:
int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

Usage:
This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.

Example:
>>> curb_65_score(1, 1, 1, 0, 1)
4
