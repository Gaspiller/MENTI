2025-08-19 20:20:08,741 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to predict the risk of major cardiac adverse events in cardiac patients in the next 6 weeks.
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with a history of hypertension, diabetes, acute myocardial infarction, abnormal ECG findings (T-wave inversion, ST-segment depression), elevated troponin I levels, coronary artery CT angiography showing calcifications, plaque formation, and stenosis, indicating atherosclerosis and acute myocardial infarction.
3. Considering the keywords "predict risk of major cardiac adverse events" and the clinical scenario of a patient with acute myocardial infarction and related risk factors, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."
4. The HEART Score is specifically designed to risk-stratify chest pain patients in the emergency setting, which aligns with the need to predict major cardiac events in the described patient.
5. Based on the detailed analysis, the chosen tool is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-19 20:20:14,093 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on the number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
