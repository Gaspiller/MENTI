2025-08-19 20:10:12,348 - INFO - Based on the User Demand, which asks for a tool to assess the 10-year risk of hard coronary heart disease, the most suitable tool from the provided list is the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease."

1. The Framingham Risk Score is specifically designed to calculate the risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease. It takes into account parameters such as age, sex, smoking status, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and medication status to estimate the risk over a 10-year period.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with severe hypertension, hypertensive heart damage, systolic heart failure, type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol levels, and related cardiovascular complications. These conditions align with the core purpose of the Framingham Risk Score to assess the risk of coronary heart disease, making it the most relevant tool for this case.

Therefore, the chosen tool from the list is:

```json
{
    "chosen_tool_name": "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease"
}

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
    - sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
    - total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    Returns:
    float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.

Step By Step Analysis:
The first parameter to analyze:
{{"age": {"Value": 49, "Unit": "years"}}}
Comparing with the Function Docstring:
- Parameter age is specified in years, which is consistent with the Function Docstring requirement.
The second parameter to analyze:
{{"sex": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}}}
Comparing with the Function Docstring:
- Parameter sex is not defined with a unit in the Parameter List, as intended in the Function Docstring.
The third parameter to analyze:
{{"smoker_status": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}}}
Comparing with the Function Docstring:
- Parameter smoker_status is not defined with a unit in the Parameter List, as intended in the Function Docstring.
The fourth parameter to analyze:
{{"total_cholesterol": {"Value": 320.92, "Unit": "mg/dL"}}}
Comparing with the Function Docstring:
- The total_cholesterol is already provided in mg/dL, as specified in the Function Docstring.
The fifth parameter to analyze:
{{"hdl_cholesterol": {"Value": 7.73, "Unit": "mg/dL"}}}
Comparing with the Function Docstring:
- The hdl_cholesterol is already provided in mg/dL, as specified in the Function Docstring.
The sixth parameter to analyze:
{{"systolic_bp": {"Value": 160, "Unit": "mm Hg"}}}
