2025-08-19 19:55:37,700 - INFO - 1. The User Demand translates to "Which scale is used to assess the risk of venous thromboembolism after acute ischemic stroke in patients?" This demand specifically mentions the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after acute ischemic stroke.

2. From the given Tool List, the tool most relevant to assessing the risk of VTE after acute ischemic stroke is the "Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)". This tool is designed to calculate the risk of VTE in surgical patients based on various risk factors.

3. The Task Scenario mentions a case of acute ischemic stroke in a patient with specific conditions like occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery and a patent foramen ovale. These conditions are related to the neurological aspects of the patient's condition rather than organ failure assessment, streptococcal infection, or major bleeding risk, aligning more closely with the risk assessment for VTE.

4. Given that the scenario highlights the patient's acute ischemic stroke and the potential risks associated with thromboembolism, the Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism is the most suitable tool to assess the patient's risk of VTE post-stroke.

Therefore, the chosen tool based on the alignment with the User Demand and Task Scenario is:
```json
{
    "chosen_tool_name": "Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)"

The score assesses the risk of VTE based on a variety of risk factors and stratifies patients for potential prophylactic interventions. Not applicable to medical (non-surgical) patients. Requires patient interaction to ascertain certain historical risk factors.

Parameters:
age (int): Patient's age in years.
sex (int): Patient's sex (0 for male, 1 for female).
surgery_type (int): Type of surgery classified by duration and invasiveness (0 for none, 1 for minor, 2 for major, 5 for elective major lower extremity arthroplasty).
recent_event (int): Recent surgeries or events (0 for none, 1 for minor, 2 for major or laparoscopic over 45 min).
major_surgery (int): Whether the patient had major surgery (0 for no, 1 for yes).
chf (int): Congestive heart failure present (0 for no, 1 for yes).
sepsis (int): Sepsis present (0 for no, 1 for yes).
pneumonia (int): Pneumonia present (0 for no, 1 for yes).
plaster_cast (int): Presence of an immobilizing plaster cast (0 for no, 2 for yes).
fracture (int): Presence of hip, pelvis, or leg fracture (0 for no, 5 for yes).
stroke (int): History of stroke (0 for no, 5 for yes).
