2025-08-19 20:15:33,274 - INFO - 1. The User Demand mentions "上消化道出血患者" which translates to "patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding." This indicates a scenario where a patient is experiencing bleeding in the upper digestive system, likely involving organs such as the stomach or esophagus.

2. The Task Scenario further describes the patient's condition, specifying that the primary issue is gastric cancer with bleeding, leading to anemia and confirming iron deficiency anemia. The scenario also mentions positive fecal occult blood test results, supporting the diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding, specifically related to gastric cancer.

3. Considering the keywords "upper gastrointestinal bleeding," "assessment," and the need to determine if outpatient treatment is suitable, a suitable tool from the provided list is the "Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)."

4. The GBS is designed to assess adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding. It evaluates parameters like hemoglobin levels, blood urea nitrogen, blood pressure, presence of melena, syncope, history of hepatic disease, and more to determine the severity of the condition and the necessity of hospital admission.

5. Given the patient's presentation with upper GI bleeding, anemia, and positive fecal occult blood test indicating bleeding, the GBS can help in stratifying the patient's risk and informing the decision on outpatient versus inpatient management.

{{Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.

Parameters:
- hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
- bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
- systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
- sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
- heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
- melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
- syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
- hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
- cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

Returns:
- int: Glasgow-Blatchford Score, ranging from 0 to 23.

This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.
