2025-08-19 20:22:07,640 - INFO - 1. User Demand: The user is asking for a tool that is used to assess the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) in patients.
2. Task Scenario: The patient in the scenario is exhibiting symptoms and signs suggestive of a mental disorder, specifically a possible intracranial infection-induced mental disorder. The treatment involves medications like Olanzapine and Oxazepam to control the mental symptoms.
3. Analysis:
   - Since the user is specifically inquiring about a tool related to Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP), we need to identify a tool from the Tool List that calculates MAP.
   - Among the tools listed, the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator directly pertains to the assessment of MAP in patients.
4. Choice:
   - Based on the alignment with the User Demand and the relevance to the task scenario, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator.
5. Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_tool_name": "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)"
}

2025-08-19 20:22:10,704 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333
Parameter List：
{{{
    "systolic_bp": {"Value": 90, "Unit": "mmHg"},
    "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 60, "Unit": "mmHg"}
}}}
Step By Step Analysis:
systolic_bp:
Function Docstring Unit: mmHg
Parameter List Unit: mmHg
Result: calculate

diastolic_bp:
Function Docstring Unit: mmHg
Parameter List Unit: mmHg
Result: calculate

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use consistent units."
