2025-08-19 20:22:28,082 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool that is used to evaluate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) of a patient.
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with symptoms and examination results indicating a possible acute ischemic stroke, affecting the right side of the body, speech, as well as showing signs of localized brain lesions.
3. Given the patient's condition and the need for further treatment and rehabilitation related to cerebrovascular issues, assessing the Mean Arterial Pressure is crucial for managing blood flow and perfusion to the brain.
4. The tool "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" from the Tool List directly aligns with the core keyword "Mean Arterial Pressure" in the User Demand and is essential in the management of patients with neurological conditions like acute stroke.
5. Therefore, the most suitable tool based on the User Demand and Task Scenario is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator.

2025-08-19 20:22:32,895 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333

Parameter Listï¼š
{
    "systolic_bp": {"Value": 180, "Unit": "mmHg"},
    "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 100, "Unit": "mmHg"}
}
Step By Step Analysis:
For parameter 'systolic_bp':
Function Docstring specifies systolic_bp Unit: mmHg
Parameter List specifies systolic_bp Unit: mmHg
Result: calculate

For parameter 'diastolic_bp':
Function Docstring specifies diastolic_bp Unit: mmHg
Parameter List specifies diastolic_bp Unit: mmHg
Result: calculate

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use the same unit of measurement."
