2025-08-19 20:36:36,227 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Corrected Sodium for Hyperglycemia using Hillier's method from 1999.

    This function computes the corrected sodium level in patients with hyperglycemia,
    accounting for osmotic shifts of water from the intracellular to the extracellular space,
    which can lead to dilutional hyponatremia. The formula uses a correction factor of 2.4 mEq/L
    for every 100 mg/dL increase in serum glucose above the normal threshold of 100 mg/dL.

    Parameters:
        measured_sodium (float): The measured sodium level in mEq/L.
        serum_glucose (float): The serum glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
        float: The corrected sodium level in mEq/L.

    Example:
        >>> sodium_correction_hyperglycemia(140, 200)
        142.4}}
    
Parameter List:
{{{"measured_sodium": {"Value": 140.0, "Unit": "mEq/L"}, "serum_glucose": {"Value": 190.97, "Unit": "mg/dL"}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
1. Parameter - measured_sodium:
    - Function Docstring Unit: mEq/L
    - Parameter List Unit: mEq/L
    - Comparison: Units match, proceed.

2. Parameter - serum_glucose:
    - Function Docstring Unit: mg/dL
    - Parameter List Unit: mg/dL
    - Comparison: Units match, proceed.

Final Answer:
