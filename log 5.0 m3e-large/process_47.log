2025-08-19 20:17:29,852 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifies the need for a tool that predicts the risk of major cardiac events within 6 weeks for a patient. This aligns with the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events" tool in the Tool List.
2. The provided Task Scenario describes a patient with multiple cardiac abnormalities, including left ventricular enlargement, reduced systolic and diastolic function, and valve regurgitation. These issues are all related to cardiac function and can contribute to an increased risk of major cardiac events.
3. The HEART Score is designed to risk-stratify patients presenting with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome, which includes assessing history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels. This tool is appropriate for evaluating the risk of major cardiac events in the given patient scenario.
4. By using the HEART Score, healthcare providers can better manage patients with chest pain and determine the appropriate level of care and monitoring needed to prevent major cardiac events within the specified timeframe of 6 weeks.

2025-08-19 20:17:34,411 - INFO - {{Calculate the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
