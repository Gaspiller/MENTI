2025-08-19 20:02:43,108 - INFO - 1. The core keyword in the User Demand is "肾小球滤过率" which translates to "glomerular filtration rate (GFR)" in English.
2. The tool in the Tool List specifically designed to calculate Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is the "CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)".
3. The CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) is intended for assessing kidney function using creatinine-based equations, aligning perfectly with the User Demand related to evaluating kidney function.
4. The task scenario highlights kidney issues, elevated serum creatinine levels, and the need to assess kidney function in the context of IgA nephropathy, all of which directly relate to the calculation of Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) using the CKD-EPI equations.
5. Therefore, the most suitable tool based on the User Demand and Task Scenario is the "CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)" from the Tool List.

{{Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.
