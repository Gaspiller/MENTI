2. The Task Scenario provides details about the patient's diagnosis of alcoholic liver cirrhosis, which is characterized by severe liver dysfunction, jaundice, bleeding tendencies, and abnormalities in liver function tests including elevated TBil, AST, and ALT.
3. Given the focus on liver function assessment and prognosis in the context of alcoholic liver cirrhosis, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis."
4. The Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index is designed to estimate the degree of liver fibrosis and can be particularly helpful in patients with liver diseases such as alcoholic liver disease, providing insights into the fibrotic stage without the need for invasive procedures like liver biopsy.
5. Based on the alignment with the core medical intent in the User Demand and the detailed information provided in the Task Scenario about the patient's liver condition, the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index aligns well with the specific requirements of assessing liver function and prognosis in the given scenario.

        platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).
        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:

Step By Step Analysis:

For age:
Parameter Docstring: 
age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.

Parameter List:
age: {"Value": null, "Unit": null}

There are no specific unit requirements for age mentioned in the Function Docstring, so the unit of "null" in the Parameter List is acceptable. We can proceed with calculating the FIB-4 Index.

For ast:
Parameter Docstring: 
ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.

Parameter List:
ast: {"Value": null, "Unit": null}

There are no specific unit requirements for AST mentioned in the Function Docstring, so the unit of "null" in the Parameter List is acceptable. We can proceed with calculating the FIB-4 Index.

For platelets:
Parameter Docstring: 
platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).

Parameter List:
platelets: {"Value": null, "Unit": "× 10⁹ / L"}

The unit of platelets in the Parameter List is consistent with the requirement in the Function Docstring. We can proceed with calculating the FIB-4 Index.

For alt:
Parameter Docstring: 
alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

Parameter List:
alt: {"Value": null, "Unit": null}

There are no specific unit requirements for ALT mentioned in the Function Docstring, so the unit of "null" in the Parameter List is acceptable. We can proceed with calculating the FIB-4 Index.
