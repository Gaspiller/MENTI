2025-08-19 20:23:12,680 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess a patient's mean arterial pressure (平均动脉压).

2. Among the tools provided in the Tool List, the tool that specifically calculates the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) based on systolic and diastolic blood pressure is the tool that aligns most closely with the User Demand.

3. The Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) tool calculates the MAP, which is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow, particularly in medical scenarios like hypertensive emergencies, such as the one described in the Task Scenario where the patient is experiencing a hypertensive crisis.

4. Given the presenting symptoms of high blood pressure (240/140mmHg) and related clinical manifestations in the Task Scenario, assessing the mean arterial pressure is essential for understanding the patient's hemodynamic status and guiding treatment decisions.

Therefore, the most suitable tool from the Tool List for assessing the patient's mean arterial pressure in this scenario is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator.

2025-08-19 20:23:17,307 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333}}

Parameter List：
{{{"systolic_bp": {"Value": 240, "Unit": "mmHg"}, "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 140, "Unit": "mmHg"}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
- For parameter 'systolic_bp':
    Function Docstring Requirement:
    - systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.

    Parameter List Information:
    - Value: 240
    - Unit: mmHg

    Comparison:
    - The unit (mmHg) of parameter 'systolic_bp' in the Parameter List matches the unit (mmHg) required in the Function Docstring.

- For parameter 'diastolic_bp':
    Function Docstring Requirement:
    - diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.

    Parameter List Information:
    - Value: 140
    - Unit: mmHg

    Comparison:
    - The unit (mmHg) of parameter 'diastolic_bp' in the Parameter List matches the unit (mmHg) required in the Function Docstring.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use the same units."
}
