2025-08-19 20:19:38,700 - INFO - 1. The User Demand focuses on predicting the risk of major cardiac events, particularly for patients with congenital heart disease.
2. The Task Scenario provides detailed information about a patient diagnosed with congenital heart disease, specifically mentioning ventricular septal defect, tricuspid regurgitation, right heart enlargement, pericardial effusion, anemia, and splenomegaly.
3. Considering the risk factors provided in the scenario, the tool that aligns most closely with predicting the risk of major cardiac events for a patient with congenital heart disease is the **HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events**. This tool assesses factors like history, age, EKG findings, risk factors, and troponin levels to stratify patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).
4. The HEART Score is directly applicable to assessing the risk of major cardiac events in patients presenting with symptoms and risk factors related to heart disease, making it the most suitable tool for the scenario described.
5. Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List based on the User Demand and Task Scenario is the **HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events**.

2025-08-19 20:19:48,580 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
