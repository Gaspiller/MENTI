2025-08-19 20:25:36,883 - INFO - 1. The core keyword in the User Demand is "抑郁症的严重程度" which translates to "severity of depression." 
2. Given that the Task Scenario describes a patient diagnosed with severe depression without psychotic symptoms, experiencing symptoms like low mood, sleep disturbances, rumination, anxiety, and worries about the future, it is clear that we need a tool to assess the severity of depression symptoms.
3. The PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) from the Tool List aligns perfectly with the User Demand and Task Scenario as it is specifically designed to diagnose depression and quantify the severity of depression symptoms based on various criteria.
4. Therefore, the most suitable tool to assess the severity of depression in this scenario is the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9).

2025-08-19 20:25:47,208 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
- "0" for 'Not at all'
- "1" for 'Several days'
- "2" for 'More than half the days'
- "3" for 'Nearly every day'
The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

Parameters:
- interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
- feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
- sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
- tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
- appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
- self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
- concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
- activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
- suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

Returns:
- int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.

Parameter List:
{{{"interest_pleasure": {"Value": 3, "Unit": null}, "feeling_down": {"Value": 3, "Unit": null}, "sleep_issues": {"Value": 3, "Unit": null}, "tired_energy": {"Value": 3, "Unit": null}, "appetite_issues": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}, "self_feeling": {"Value": 3, "Unit": null}, "concentration": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}, "activity_level": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, "suicidal_thoughts": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}}}}
Step By Step Analysis:
The interest_pleasure parameter complies with the Function Docstring's requirement of an integer index from 0 to 3 for frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.

The feeling_down parameter complies with the Function Docstring's requirement of an integer index from 0 to 3 for frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.

The sleep_issues parameter complies with the Function Docstring's requirement of an integer index from 0 to 3 for trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.

The tired_energy parameter complies with the Function Docstring's requirement of an integer index from 0 to 3 for feeling tired or having little energy.

The appetite_issues parameter complies with the Function Docstring's requirement of an integer index from 0 to 3 for issues with poor appetite or overeating.

The self_feeling parameter complies with the Function Docstring's requirement of an integer index from 0 to 3 for feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.

The concentration parameter complies with the Function Docstring's requirement of an integer index from 0 to 3 for trouble concentrating on things.

The activity_level parameter complies with the Function Docstring's requirement of an integer index from 0 to 3 for altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.

The suicidal_thoughts parameter complies with the Function Docstring's requirement of an integer index from 0 to 3 for frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.
