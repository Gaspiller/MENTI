2. The Task Scenario describes a pregnant patient without a history of ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, or congestive heart failure. This suggests a low likelihood of significant cardiovascular issues.
3. Considering the core medical intent and keywords in the Demand, the suitable tool from the list would be "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
4. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is specifically designed for assessing cardiac risk in the preoperative setting, aligning well with the Task Scenario of preoperative evaluation.
5. Based on the analysis, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List is "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-19 20:31:10,059 - INFO - {{"Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
