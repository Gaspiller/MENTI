2025-08-14 00:43:36,381 - INFO - 1. nervous (int):
- In the Reference Text, there is no direct mention of feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge, which corresponds to this parameter in the function docstring.
- Given the mention of symptoms like feeling nervous, anxious, having heart palpitations, dizziness, restlessness, and vision changes, a score can be inferred for feeling nervous.
- Based on the severity of the symptoms described, a score of 2 seems appropriate for feeling nervous.

2. control_worrying (int):
- The patient in the Reference Text does not explicitly mention the inability to stop or control worrying, which relates to this parameter.
- However, the patient's long medical history, medication for chronic conditions, and multiple diagnoses could be indicative of some level of worry.
- Considering the patient's situation, a score of 1 for not being able to stop or control worrying is reasoned.

3. worry_too_much (int):
- There is no direct mention of worrying too much in the Reference Text, but the presence of various health conditions and symptoms could contribute to this factor.
- Given the patient's overall medical history and the possible impact of worrying on their conditions, a score of 1 for worrying too much is assumed.

4. trouble_relaxing (int):
- The patient describes symptoms such as agitation, physical discomfort, and restlessness, which align with having trouble relaxing.
- Based on the patient's discomfort and the inability to relax, a score of 3 for having trouble relaxing is reasonable.

5. restlessness (int):
- The patient expresses symptoms of restlessness, inability to sit still, and leg discomfort, indicating a state of restlessness.
- Considering the patient's restless symptoms, a score of 2 for restlessness is understood.

6. irritability (int):
- The patient mentions becoming easily annoyed, indicating irritability.
- Based on the patient's irritability and agitation, a score of 2 for irritability is assumed.

7. fear_of_awful_events (int):
- The patient reports feeling afraid and worried about potential negative outcomes, aligning with a fear of awful events.
- Given the patient's fear and anxiety about hospital treatment, a score of 1 for fear of awful events is inferred.

2025-08-14 00:43:46,788 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
    based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
    2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

    This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
    including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
    It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
    to assess and monitor treatment responses.

    Parameters:
    - nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
    - control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
    - worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
    - trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
    - restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
    - irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
    - fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

    Returns:
    int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

    Usage Example:
    gad_7_score = calculate_gad_7(3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
    print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score
