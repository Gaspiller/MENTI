2025-08-14 00:54:45,396 - INFO - 1. history_score: 
Based on the patient's clinical diagnosis, there is no clear indication of the patient's history score; however, the patient has a congenital heart disease with a septal defect and mild tricuspid regurgitation. Considering the complexity of the heart condition, we can infer that the history_score would likely be at least "Moderately suspicious" (1) or even "Highly suspicious" (2). Therefore, we will assign a value of 1 to history_score.

2. ekg_score: 
The electrocardiogram (EKG) findings mentioned include incomplete right bundle branch block and abnormal T waves in multiple leads. These findings indicate some abnormalities but not significant ST deviation. Hence, we will assign a value of 1 to ekg_score for "Non-specific repolarization disturbance."

3. age_score: 
The patient's age is provided as 37 years old. According to the age categories, this falls between 45 and 64 years, so we will assign a value of 1 to age_score.

4. risk_factors_score: 
There is no explicit mention of the number of cardiovascular risk factors. Given the presence of congenital heart disease, slight tricuspid regurgitation, right heart enlargement, and anemia, we can infer that the patient likely has at least 1–2 risk factors. Therefore, we will assign a value of 1 to risk_factors_score.

5. troponin_score: 
The troponin level of the patient is mentioned to be within the normal range (1-3 times normal limit). Since the troponin level is not explicitly stated, and assuming it is within normal limits, we will assign a value of 0 to troponin_score.

2025-08-14 00:54:52,653 - INFO - {{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
