2025-08-14 00:51:49,879 - INFO - 1. Based on the User Demand, the tool needed is for predicting the risk of major cardiac events within 6 weeks. This indicates the need for a tool that can assess the cardiac risk in the given patient scenario.

2. Looking at the provided scenarios, the patient's condition involves multiple cardiac-related issues such as impaired left ventricular function, valvular regurgitation, pulmonary hypertension, and abnormal liver function. These factors contribute to the overall risk of major cardiac events.

3. Considering the complexity of the patient's cardiac issues and the need for risk prediction, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

4. The HEART Score takes into account various factors including patient history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels to stratify patients into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome.

5. By calculating the HEART Score for this patient, it would provide valuable insights into the risk of major cardiac events within the specified timeframe, helping guide further management and treatment decisions.

2025-08-14 00:51:55,940 - INFO - 1. history_score (int):
- The patient's age is 65 years old, which falls into the category of "65 or older" in the history_score parameter.
- Therefore, the history_score Value is 2.

2. ekg_score (int):
- The EKG findings show "ST段弓背抬高伴异常Q波形成", which corresponds to "Significant ST deviation" in the ekg_score parameter.
- Therefore, the ekg_score Value is 2.

3. age_score (int):
- The patient's age is 65 years old, falling into the category of "65 or older" in the age_score parameter.
- Therefore, the age_score Value is 2.

4. risk_factors_score (int):
- There is no explicit mention of the number of cardiovascular risk factors in the Reference Text. Based on the patient's age and medical history provided, it is plausible to assume the presence of "3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease", which corresponds to a score of 2 in the risk_factors_score parameter.
- Therefore, the risk_factors_score Value is 2.

5. troponin_score (int):
- The troponin level is mentioned in the lab results: "心肌肌钙蛋白 4.38 μg/L".
- Given that the troponin level is provided as 4.38 μg/L, it falls into the category of ">3 times normal limit" in the troponin_score parameter.
- Therefore, the troponin_score Value is 2.

    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
