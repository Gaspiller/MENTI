2025-08-14 00:34:09,196 - INFO - 1. The user demand is asking for the assessment tool used to evaluate the severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).

2. Reviewing the detailed information provided for each tool in the Tool List:
   a. The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score assesses organ function and failure in critically ill patients, not specific to pneumonia.
   b. The HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events is used for risk stratification in patients with chest pain.
   c. The Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) is used to assess the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus in patients with pharyngitis.
   d. The Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism assesses the risk of VTE specifically in surgical patients.
   e. The PSI/PORT Score is used to assess the severity of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).
   f. The ARISCAT Score predicts the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications.
   g. The APACHE II Score assesses severity and predicts mortality in ICU patients.
   h. The Child-Pugh Score estimates prognosis for cirrhosis patients.
   i. The Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index estimates liver fibrosis.
   j. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index assesses the risk of major cardiac complications in non-cardiac surgery.

3. Given the user scenario of assessing the severity of pneumonia in a patient with bronchitis and pneumonia symptoms, the appropriate tool to choose from the list is the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

{{"Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
    It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    sex (str): Patient's sex, either 'Female' or 'Male'.
    nursing_home_resident (bool): True if the patient is a nursing home resident, False otherwise.
    neoplastic_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of neoplastic disease, False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of liver disease, False otherwise.
    chf_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, False otherwise.
    cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of cerebrovascular disease, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of renal disease, False otherwise.
    altered_mental_status (bool): True if the patient has altered mental status, False otherwise.
    respiratory_rate (bool): True if respiratory rate is ≥30 breaths/min, False otherwise.
    systolic_bp (bool): True if systolic blood pressure is <90 mmHg, False otherwise.
    temperature (bool): True if temperature is <35°C or >39.9°C, False otherwise.
    pulse (bool): True if pulse rate is ≥125 beats/min, False otherwise.
    blood_ph (bool): True if blood pH is <7.35, False otherwise.
    bun (bool): True if BUN is ≥30 mg/dL or ≥11 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    sodium (bool): True if sodium level is <130 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    glucose (bool): True if glucose level is ≥250 mg/dL or ≥14 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    hematocrit (bool): True if hematocrit is <30%, False otherwise.
    oxygen_pressure (bool): True if partial pressure of oxygen is <60 mmHg or <8 kPa, False otherwise.
    pleural_effusion (bool): True if there is pleural effusion on x-ray, False otherwise.
