2025-08-14 00:31:58,662 - INFO - 1. age:
   - From the reference text, the patient is a 47-year-old female.
   - Therefore, the age parameter should be:
     - Value: 47

2. spo2:
   - No explicit mention of preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) percentage in the reference text.
   - Since the patient is stable and there is no indication of hypoxia, it can be assumed that the SpO2 is within normal range.
   - Let's assume a normal SpO2 percentage of 98% for this patient.
   - Therefore, the spo2 parameter should be:
     - Value: 98
     - Unit: %

3. respiratory_infection:
   - No clear indication of a recent respiratory infection in the reference text.
   - Since the patient's symptoms are primarily related to chronic respiratory issues, it can be assumed that there is no active respiratory infection at the moment.
   - Therefore, the respiratory_infection parameter should be:
     - Value: 0

4. anemia:
   - No explicit mention of preoperative anemia in the reference text.
   - Since the patient's symptoms do not suggest acute anemia, it can be assumed that there is no preoperative anemia.
   - Therefore, the anemia parameter should be:
     - Value: 0

5. surgical_incision:
   - No direct mention of the type of surgical incision in the reference text.
   - Since the patient's condition is related to pulmonary issues, it is likely that they may undergo upper abdominal surgery for further evaluation and treatment based on the chest X-ray findings.
   - Therefore, the surgical_incision parameter should be:
     - Value: 1

6. surgery_duration:
   - No specific mention of the duration of surgery in the reference text.
   - Since the patient's case involves further evaluation of a pulmonary mass, it can be assumed that the surgery may be of moderate duration.
   - Let's assume a surgery duration of 3 hours for this patient.
   - Therefore, the surgery_duration parameter should be:
     - Value: 3
     - Unit: hours

7. emergency:
   - No indication in the reference text whether the procedure was performed as an emergency.
   - Since there are no urgent symptoms mentioned and the patient is stable, it can be assumed that the procedure was not an emergency.
   - Therefore, the emergency parameter should be:
     - Value: 0

2025-08-14 00:32:07,219 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications.
    This score helps predict the risk of pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery under general, neuraxial, or regional anesthesia.

Parameters:
age (int): Patient's age in years.
spo2 (int): Preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) percentage.
respiratory_infection (int): Indicates the presence of respiratory infection in the last month. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
anemia (int): Indicates preoperative anemia (Hgb ≤10 g/dL). 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
surgical_incision (int): Type of surgical incision. 0 for 'Peripheral', 1 for 'Upper abdominal', 2 for 'Intrathoracic'.
surgery_duration (int): Duration of the surgery in hours.
emergency (int): Indicates if the procedure was an emergency. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.

Returns:
int: The ARISCAT score, which is a summation of points based on the provided parameters.

Parameter List：
{
    "age": {"Value": 47, "Unit": null},
    "spo2": {"Value": 98, "Unit": "%"},
