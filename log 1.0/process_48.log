2025-08-14 00:52:23,796 - INFO - 1. 根据用户需求，用户需要知道哪一个量表可用于预测患者在接下来的6周内发生重大心脏不良事件的风险。
2. 在提供的工具列表中，可选项包括HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events，Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk，Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease等。
3. 根据患者病例情况，患者被诊断为风湿性心脏病，合并心功能IV级，心律失常包括心房颤动和三度房室传导阻滞，以及其他心脏问题。
4. 针对重大心脏不良事件的风险预测，HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events是一个较为合适的工具，因为该工具可以帮助风险分层急诊科病人中的患者，尤其是胸痛病人，将其分为低、中和高风险组。
5. 基于以上分析，选择HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events。

2025-08-14 00:52:29,941 - INFO - 1. history_score: Based on the patient's clinical history provided in the reference text, there is no direct mention of the patient's history score. However, given the patient's age of 68 years and the diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease with valve issues, it is reasonable to infer that the history_score would be "Highly suspicious" (score of 2) considering the complexity of the cardiovascular condition.

2. ekg_score: The reference text mentions that the patient has atrial fibrillation and complete heart block. While there is no explicit EKG findings mentioned in the text, the presence of atrial fibrillation and heart block are significant EKG abnormalities. Therefore, it is reasonable to assign an ekg_score of 2 (Significant ST deviation).

3. age_score: The patient's age is explicitly mentioned as 68 years in the reference text, which falls into the category of "65 or older". Hence, the age_score would be 2.

4. risk_factors_score: The reference text provides information about the patient's medical history, including hypertension, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and atrial fibrillation. Considering these risk factors, it is appropriate to assign a risk_factors_score of 2 (3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease).

5. troponin_score: The troponin levels of the patient are not explicitly mentioned in the reference text. Given the patient's history of cardiovascular issues and chest pain symptoms, it is reasonable to assume that the troponin levels might be elevated. Therefore, assigning a troponin_score of 1 (1-3 times normal limit) would be appropriate based on the clinical context.

2025-08-14 00:52:37,239 - INFO - {{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7"
