2025-08-14 00:53:31,869 - INFO - 1. Given the User Demand, we need to find a tool from the Tool List that is used to predict the risk of major cardiac events for patients undergoing coronary angiography + left heart catheterization.

2. The tool that best fits this scenario is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events." This tool calculates the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) based on patient history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels. It helps risk-stratify patients with chest pain, which is relevant in the context of coronary angiography and left heart catheterization.

Final Answer:

{
    "chosen_tool_name": "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"
}

2025-08-14 00:53:38,074 - INFO - 1. history_score:
- Based on the patient's clinical history and symptoms, we don't have a clear indication of the history_score provided in the Reference Text.
- We can infer a history_score of 1 (Moderately suspicious) considering the patient's age (60 years) and the presentation of chest pain with suspected acute coronary syndrome.
- Therefore, history_score: 1

2. ekg_score:
- The Reference Text mentions that the patient's electrocardiogram (ECG) is normal which corresponds to ekg_score of 0.
- Therefore, ekg_score: 0

3. age_score:
- The patient's age is clearly stated in the Reference Text as 60 years.
- According to the age_score criteria, an age of 60 falls into the category of 2 (65 or older).
- Therefore, age_score: 2

4. risk_factors_score:
- The Reference Text does not provide explicit information about the number of cardiovascular risk factors the patient has.
- However, given the patient's age and history of hypertension, we can infer that the patient might have 3 or more risk factors or a history of atherosclerotic disease.
- Therefore, risk_factors_score: 2

5. troponin_score:
- The Reference Text mentions that the patient's troponin levels are normal, indicating a troponin_score of 0 according to the provided scoring guidelines.
- Therefore, troponin_score: 0

Parameters List:

2025-08-14 00:53:44,697 - INFO - {{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
