2025-08-14 00:56:16,873 - INFO - 1. 根据用户需求，用户需要使用一个量表来预测患者在6周内发生重大心脏不良事件的风险。
2. 根据任务场景，患者被诊断为具有冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病，需要评估其冠脉供血不足的风险。

根据用户需求和任务场景的描述，最适合的工具是 "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"。这个工具可以帮助确定急诊科（ED）病人胸痛的风险程度，将其分为低、中、高风险组，有助于指导急诊情况下胸痛患者的进一步管理。

2025-08-14 00:56:21,152 - INFO - 1. history_score:
Based on the patient's history, there is no direct mention of the level of suspicion related to cardiac events, which is the basis for calculating the history_score. However, it is stated that the patient has a history of coronary artery atherosclerosis, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, cerebral artery stenosis, and narrowing of the left posterior cerebral artery. Given the complexity and severity of these conditions, it is reasonable to assign a score of 2, indicating a highly suspicious history.

2. ekg_score:
The reference text does not provide specific EKG findings for the patient. Since the EKG is normal, it is appropriate to assign a score of 0 for ekg_score.

3. age_score:
The patient is a 55-year-old male, falling in the age range of 45 to 64 years. Therefore, the age_score should be 1.

4. risk_factors_score:
From the clinical diagnosis, it is evident that the patient has multiple cardiovascular risk factors, including atherosclerotic heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cerebral artery narrowing. These conditions correspond to having 3 or more risk factors or a history of atherosclerotic disease. Hence, the risk_factors_score should be 2.

5. troponin_score:
The troponin level for the patient is within the normal range. Therefore, the troponin_score should be 0.

Parameters List:
```json
{
    "history_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": "null"},
    "ekg_score": {"Value": 0, "Unit": "null"},
    "age_score": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"},
    "risk_factors_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": "null"},
    "troponin_score": {"Value": 0, "Unit": "null"}

2025-08-14 00:56:30,515 - INFO - {{Function Docstring:
Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Args:
history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
    0 = Slightly suspicious,
    1 = Moderately suspicious,
    2 = Highly suspicious.
ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
    0 = Normal,
    1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
    2 = Significant ST deviation.
age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
    0 = less than 45,
    1 = between 45 and 64,
    2 = 65 or older.
risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
    0 = No known risk factors,
    1 = 1–2 risk factors,
    2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
    0 = ≤ normal limit,
    1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
    2 = >3 times normal limit.

Returns:
int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
     in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
     0-3 points indicate low risk,
     4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
     7-10 points indicate high risk.

Example:
>>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
7
