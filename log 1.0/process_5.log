2025-08-14 00:20:15,239 - INFO - 1. Age:
Since the reference text mentions that the patient is 89 years old, the age parameter should be set to 89.

2. Sex:
The reference text states that the patient is female, so the sex parameter should be set to 'female'.

3. History of Congestive Heart Failure:
Although the reference text does not explicitly mention a history of congestive heart failure, it does state that the patient has a history of coronary heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure. Given this information, we can infer that the patient likely has a history of congestive heart failure. Therefore, the history_of_congestive_heart_failure parameter should be set to True.

4. History of Hypertension:
The reference text does not directly state a history of hypertension. However, given the patient's age and history of coronary heart disease, it is common for patients with these conditions to have a history of hypertension. Therefore, the history_of_hypertension parameter should be set to True.

5. History of Stroke, TIA, or Thromboembolism:
The reference text does not explicitly mention a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism. However, it does mention that the patient has a history of cardiovascular diseases, which could include conditions that increase the risk of stroke. Thus, the history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism parameter should be set to True based on this inference.

6. History of Vascular Disease:
The reference text mentions a history of coronary heart disease, which is a type of vascular disease. Therefore, the history_of_vascular_disease parameter should be set to True.

7. History of Diabetes:
Although the reference text does not mention a history of diabetes, given the patient's age and history of cardiovascular diseases, there is a higher likelihood of having diabetes. Therefore, the history_of_diabetes parameter should be set to True.

2025-08-14 00:20:23,300 - INFO - {{"Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
    - history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(75, 'female', True, True, True, True, True)
