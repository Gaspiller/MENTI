2025-08-14 00:20:42,414 - INFO - 1. The user demand is to identify which tool is used to assess the stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation. From the tool list provided, the suitable tool for this purpose is the "CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk".

2. The user's scenario describes a patient with rheumatoid arthritis and rheumatic heart disease with mitral valve stenosis, leading to potential heart failure. The focus is on assessing the stroke risk in the context of atrial fibrillation, which is common in patients with heart conditions such as mitral valve stenosis.

3. The CHA2DS2-VASc Score is designed specifically to estimate the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation. It considers factors such as age, sex, history of congestive heart failure, hypertension, stroke, vascular disease, and diabetes to calculate the stroke risk score.

4. Given the patient's history of cardiac symptoms, including palpitations, shortness of breath, and mitral valve stenosis, assessing the stroke risk using the CHA2DS2-VASc Score would be clinically relevant in this case.

{{Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
    - history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(75, 'female', True, True, True, True, True)
