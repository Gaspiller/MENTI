2. 在给定的工具列表中，可以选择"Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS)"作为适合的工具，因为它用于评估患者的神经系统状态和昏迷程度。
3. GCS是通过评估患者的眼睛、言语和运动反应来计算得分，从而帮助医疗人员了解患者的意识水平和神经系统功能。
4. 在这种情况下，根据患者的病史和症状，GCS可以帮助医护人员评估患者的意识状态和可能存在的神经系统障碍。
5. 因此，在这种情况下，最适合的工具是"Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS)"。

2025-08-14 00:44:10,862 - INFO - 1. eye_response:
   - The reference text does not provide a specific score for eye response, but it mentions that the patient cannot open eyes. Based on the scoring standards in the Function Docstring, a patient who cannot open their eyes would likely fall under the category of 'NT' (not testable).
   - Therefore, the value of the eye_response parameter should be 'NT' (not testable).

2. verbal_response:
   - The reference text does not provide a specific score for verbal response, but it mentions that the patient is uncooperative and cannot speak. Since the patient is not providing any verbal response, it aligns with the description of 'no verbal response' in the scoring standards.
   - Based on this, the value of the verbal_response parameter should be 1 (no verbal response).

3. motor_response:
   - The reference text does not provide a specific score for motor response, but it mentions that there are no pathological reflexes. This suggests that the patient is not responding with any motor actions.
   - Matching this with the scoring standards, the lack of motor response aligns with a score of 1 (no motor response).
   - Therefore, the value of the motor_response parameter should be 1 (no motor response).

Parameters List:
```json
{
    "eye_response": {"Value": "NT", "Unit": null},
    "verbal_response": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null},
    "motor_response": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}

2025-08-14 00:44:16,684 - INFO - {{"Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed."}}

{{"eye_response": {"Value": "NT", "Unit": null}}}
Function Docstring Analysis:
- eye_response: Accepts an integer score or 'NT' for not testable. No specific unit mentioned.

Parameter List Analysis:
- eye_response: The provided value is "NT".

Comparison:
- The unit requirement in the Function Docstring and the unit of the provided parameter match.

Next Step:
Since the units match, we should proceed with calculating the GCS score.

Summary:
All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as no specific unit is mentioned for the parameters.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as no specific unit is mentioned for the parameters."
