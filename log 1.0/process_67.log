2025-08-14 01:03:14,234 - INFO - - Based on the user demand, we need to choose a tool that is used to assess the severity of depression in a patient.
- The tool that matches this requirement from the tool list is the "PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)".
- The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and quantify the severity of depressive symptoms based on the DSM criteria for MDD.
- It evaluates various symptoms such as interest/pleasure, feeling down, sleep issues, tiredness, appetite problems, self-feelings, concentration, activity levels, and suicidal thoughts.
- The total score from the PHQ-9 ranges from 0 to 27, indicating the severity of depression symptoms.
- Given the patient's presentation of severe depression with symptoms like poor sleep, anxiety, excessive worry, suicidal ideation, and motor symptoms, the PHQ-9 would be an appropriate tool to assess the severity of her depressive symptoms.

2025-08-14 01:03:27,803 - INFO - - interest_pleasure: Based on the patient's description, she has been feeling down, worried, and sad for multiple reasons such as financial issues and catastrophe. She expressed a lack of interest or pleasure in things, as evident from statements like "心情差" (feeling down) and "多虑" (worried). Considering the severity and frequency of these symptoms, we can assign a score of 2 for interest_pleasure.

- feeling_down: The patient's main complaint includes feeling down, depressed, and hopeless. She mentioned phrases like "心情差" (feeling down), "半夜醒来，凌晨出去打工" (trouble with sleep), and "没钱、赚多少钱也不够小孩学费" (feeling hopeless due to financial constraints). Given the intensity and duration of these feelings, a score of 3 for feeling_down seems appropriate.

- sleep_issues: The patient reported having poor sleep quality, waking up in the middle of the night, and facing difficulties falling asleep. She expressed symptoms like "夜眠差" (trouble sleeping at night), "凌晨五点便出去打工" (early awakening), and "白天显疲倦" (daytime fatigue). These symptoms indicate significant trouble with sleep, warranting a score of 3 for sleep_issues.

- tired_energy: The patient mentioned feeling tired, fatigued, and lacking energy during the day. She described herself as "显疲倦" (obvious fatigue) and only getting "两三个小时" of sleep per day. Considering the impact of fatigue on her daily functioning, we can assign a score of 3 for tired_energy.

- appetite_issues: The reference text did not provide clear information about appetite issues. However, the patient's focus on financial problems and lack of interest in daily activities may suggest appetite disturbances such as poor appetite or overeating. Given this uncertainty, we can assign a score of 1 for appetite_issues as a conservative estimate.

- self_feeling: The patient expressed feelings of worry, guilt, and self-blame. She mentioned "称自己做了孽" (self-blaming), "小孩没有钱给他们" (feeling guilty about financial support), and "称要赚多少钱才行" (constant worrying about money). These symptoms indicate a negative self-perception, justifying a score of 2 for self_feeling.

- concentration: The patient exhibited signs of poor concentration and cognitive difficulties, as seen in statements like "计算账、称要赚多少钱才行" (trouble with calculations) and "反复讲钱的问题" (repeatedly talking about money). These issues suggest impaired concentration, warranting a score of 2 for concentration.

- activity_level: The patient displayed altered activity levels, such as restlessness ("反复做摇头晃脑的动作"), difficulty sitting still, and restlessness ("凌晨五点便出去打工"). These behaviors indicate changes in activity levels, corresponding to a score of 2 for activity_level.

- suicidal_thoughts: While the patient denied suicidal ideation explicitly in the reference text, phrases like "有时称将小孩叫回来一起自相残杀、一家十口人死了都不够" (mentioning harming family members) and "有信佛的人认为可能有鬼上她的身" (suggesting strange beliefs) indicate some distorted thoughts. Given the severity, a score of 2 for suicidal_thoughts is reasonable.

{{Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.
