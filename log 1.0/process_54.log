2025-08-14 00:55:46,391 - INFO - 1. 根据用户需求，用户希望了解用于评估患者在未来6周发生重大心脏不良事件风险的量表。这表明用户需要一个用于评估心脏风险的工具。

2. 在提供的量表列表中，有几个工具与心脏风险评估相关，包括“HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events”和“CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk”。

3. 根据任务场景描述，患者出现了急性非ST段抬高型下壁心肌梗死，导致了三度房室传导阻滞，同时也患有2型糖尿病。考虑到患者可能存在心脏功能障碍、心律失常和糖尿病等情况，更适合选择“HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events”这个工具进行评估。

4. 因此，在这种情况下，我选择“HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events”这个工具来评估患者在未来6周发生重大心脏不良事件的风险。

2025-08-14 00:55:50,239 - INFO - 1. history_score:
Based on the patient's clinical diagnosis, we can infer that the patient has a history of coronary artery disease, acute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, and diabetes, which are all major risk factors for cardiac events. Therefore, we can assign a "2" score to history_score as the patient's history is highly suspicious.

2. ekg_score:
The EKG findings indicate "significant ST-T changes, and third degree atrioventricular block." This aligns with the criteria for a "2" score in the EKG category.

3. age_score:
The patient is 70 years old, which falls into the category of "65 or older" in the age scoring system. So, the age_score would be "2".

4. risk_factors_score:
The patient has a history of diabetes, which is a significant cardiovascular risk factor. Therefore, we can assign a "2" score to the risk_factors_score.

5. troponin_score:
The initial troponin level was 22.3ng/ml, which is above the normal limit. Based on the troponin scoring system, this would correspond to a score of "2".

2025-08-14 00:55:56,629 - INFO - {{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

Step By Step Analysis: 

For history_score:
Function Docstring requires an integer value representing the patient history assessment score without specifying a unit. 
Parameter List provides a value of 2 without a unit.
Since the Function Docstring and Parameter List are consistent in terms of value and unit, the decision is to "calculate".

For ekg_score:
Function Docstring requires an integer value representing the EKG findings score without specifying a unit. 
Parameter List provides a value of 2 without a unit.
Since the Function Docstring and Parameter List are consistent in terms of value and unit, the decision is to "calculate".

For age_score:
Function Docstring requires an integer value representing the patient's age score without specifying a unit. 
Parameter List provides a value of 2 without a unit.
Since the Function Docstring and Parameter List are consistent in terms of value and unit, the decision is to "calculate".

For risk_factors_score:
Function Docstring requires an integer value representing the cardiovascular risk factors score without specifying a unit. 
Parameter List provides a value of 2 without a unit.
Since the Function Docstring and Parameter List are consistent in terms of value and unit, the decision is to "calculate".

For troponin_score:
Function Docstring requires an integer value representing the initial troponin levels score without specifying a unit. 
Parameter List provides a value of 2 without a unit.
Since the Function Docstring and Parameter List are consistent in terms of value and unit, the decision is to "calculate".

Final Answer:

{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters are integer values without units specified in the Function Docstring."
