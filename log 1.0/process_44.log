2025-08-14 00:48:53,608 - INFO - 1. Identify the 'hypertension' parameter:
   - Reference Text: The patient has "high blood pressure (2nd level, very high risk)".
   - Analysis: The patient has high blood pressure, so the parameter 'hypertension' should be True.
  
2. Identify the 'renal_disease' parameter:
   - Reference Text: There is no clear mention of renal disease in the text.
   - Analysis: Since there is no explicit mention of renal disease, we assume that the patient does not have renal disease, so the parameter 'renal_disease' should be False.

3. Identify the 'liver_disease' parameter:
   - Reference Text: The patient has no history of liver disease.
   - Analysis: The patient does not have liver disease, so the parameter 'liver_disease' should be False.
  
4. Identify the 'stroke_history' parameter:
   - Reference Text: The patient has had "old cerebral infarction".
   - Analysis: The patient has a history of stroke, so the parameter 'stroke_history' should be True.
  
5. Identify the 'major_bleeding_history' parameter:
   - Reference Text: There is no direct mention of prior major bleeding.
   - Analysis: Since there is no clear indication of prior major bleeding, we assume that the patient has no history of major bleeding, so the parameter 'major_bleeding_history' should be False.
  
6. Identify the 'labile_inr' parameter:
   - Reference Text: There is no information about labile INR in the text.
   - Analysis: In the absence of information, we assume that labile INR is not present, so the parameter 'labile_inr' should be False.
  
7. Identify the 'elderly' parameter:
   - Reference Text: The patient is 54 years old.
   - Analysis: The patient is not explicitly described as elderly (age >65), but given the age of 54, we can infer that the patient is not elderly, so the parameter 'elderly' should be False.

8. Identify the 'medication_risk' parameter:
   - Reference Text: The patient's medication history includes aspirin.
   - Analysis: The patient uses medication that predisposes to bleeding (aspirin), so the parameter 'medication_risk' should be True.
  
9. Identify the 'alcohol_usage' parameter:
   - Reference Text: There is no information about significant alcohol consumption.
   - Analysis: Since there is no information about alcohol usage, we assume that the patient does not consume alcohol significantly, so the parameter 'alcohol_usage' should be False.

2025-08-14 00:48:58,030 - INFO - {{"Calculate the HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.
    
    The HAS-BLED Score is used to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding and helps guide decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy.
    This scoring system can be considered alongside other bleeding risk scores or thromboembolic risk assessments to weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation.

    Parameters:
    hypertension (bool): True if the patient has hypertension, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has renal disease (dialysis, transplant, or Cr >2.26 mg/dL), False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has liver disease (cirrhosis or bilirubin >2x normal with AST/ALT/AP >3x normal), False otherwise.
    stroke_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, False otherwise.
    major_bleeding_history (bool): True if the patient has had prior major bleeding or predisposition to bleeding, False otherwise.
    labile_inr (bool): True if the patient has labile INR (unstable/high INRs, time in therapeutic range <60%), False otherwise.
    elderly (bool): True if the patient is elderly (age >65), False otherwise.
    medication_risk (bool): True if the patient uses medication that predisposes to bleeding (aspirin, clopidogrel, NSAIDs), False otherwise.
    alcohol_usage (bool): True if the patient consumes alcohol significantly (≥8 drinks/week), False otherwise.

    Returns:
    int: The total HAS-BLED score, which is a sum of all applicable risk factors.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_has_bled_score(True, False, False, True, False, True, True, False, True)

Step By Step Analysis:
The parameter list units don't match with the required units in the Function Docstring. We need to convert the parameter values accordingly.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters are boolean values."
}
