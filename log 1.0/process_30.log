2025-08-14 00:37:59,000 - INFO - 1. Age: 
From the reference text, the patient is 56 years old.

2. Sex:
Based on the reference text, the patient is male.

3. Surgery Type:
There is no specific mention of surgery type in the reference text, but since the patient has been admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain and is being evaluated for possible surgery based on the physical examination findings, we can assume that the surgery type is major due to the seriousness of the condition. Therefore, we can assign a value of 2 (major) for surgery type.

4. Recent Event:
There is no clear indication of recent surgeries or events in the reference text. Since the patient is admitted to the hospital with abdominal pain as the main complaint, we can assume that there have been no recent surgeries or major events. Therefore, we can assign a value of 0 (none) for recent events.

5. Major Surgery:
The reference text does not specifically mention whether the patient had major surgery previously. Since the patient is being evaluated for surgery due to the current abdominal pain, we can infer that there has been no major surgery. Therefore, we can assign a value of 0 (no) for major surgery.

6. CHF (Congestive Heart Failure):
There is no mention of congestive heart failure in the reference text. Since there are no indications of heart failure, we can assign a value of 0 (no) for CHF.

7. Sepsis, Pneumonia, Plaster Cast, Fracture, Stroke, Multiple Trauma, Spinal Injury, Varicose Veins, Swollen Legs, and Central Venous Access:
There are no clear indications in the reference text regarding the presence of these risk factors. We can assume that these risk factors are not present based on the provided information. Therefore, we can assign a value of 0 (no) for each of these parameters.

8. History of DVT/PE (Deep Vein Thrombosis/Pulmonary Embolism) and Family Thrombosis:
There is no mention of a history of DVT or PE in the reference text. Based on the absence of this information, we can assign a value of 0 (no) for both parameters.

9. Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin 20210A, Homocysteine, Lupus Anticoagulant, Anticardiolipin Antibody, Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia, and Thrombophilia:
There is no information in the reference text regarding these risk factors. Since there are no mentions of these factors, we can assign a value of 0 (no) for each parameter.

10. Mobility:
There is no specific information about the patient's mobility status in the reference text. We can assume that the patient has normal mobility status since there are no indications of mobility restrictions. Therefore, we can assign a value of 0 (normal) for mobility.

11. IBD (Inflammatory Bowel Disease), BMI Over 25, Acute MI (Myocardial Infarction), COPD (Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), Malignancy, Other Risk Factors, Contraceptives/Hormones, and Reproductive History:
There is no mention of these risk factors in the reference text. Since there are no indications of these conditions, we can assign a value of 0 (no) for each parameter.
