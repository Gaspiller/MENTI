2. 根据用户需求和情景描述中提到患者存在意识模糊的症状，辅助检查显示生化指标异常，包括电解质的改变和肾功能的异常，可以初步判断患者可能存在意识障碍与肾脏功能损害。在这种情况下，更为全面和专业的评估患者神志状态和意识水平可以选择使用Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score，该评分系统涵盖了多个器官的功能评估，适用于重症监护患者的状态跟踪和评估。

3. 因此，根据分析，选择适用于评估患者的神志状态和意识水平的工具为Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score。

2025-08-14 00:44:45,562 - INFO - 1. pao2_fio2_ratio:
   - The pao2_fio2_ratio is a ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen.
   - The Reference Text does not provide the specific values for partial pressure of arterial oxygen (PaO2) and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2), so we need to infer them based on common values seen in practice.
   - For a patient with ventilatory support in the ICU, a common value for PaO2 is around 80 mmHg and a common value for FiO2 is around 0.21 (room air).
   - Therefore, we can infer a value for pao2_fio2_ratio based on these assumptions.

2. platelets:
   - The Reference Text does not provide a specific platelet count, so we need to infer it based on common ranges seen in practice for patients in the ICU.
   - A normal platelet count is around 150,000 to 450,000 platelets per microliter (µL).
   - Given that the patient is critically ill and may have altered platelet counts due to their condition, we can assume a platelet count within this normal range.

3. glasgow_coma_scale:
   - The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) is a scale used to assess a patient's level of consciousness.
   - The Reference Text mentions that the patient is unable to communicate, responds slowly, and has a Glasgow Coma Scale score that is likely less than 15, which indicates altered mental status.
   - We can infer a value for the glasgow_coma_scale based on the patient's described symptoms, which suggest a reduced level of consciousness.

4. bilirubin:
   - The Reference Text provides the serum bilirubin level in mg/dL as part of the biochemical profile.
   - The specific value for bilirubin in the Reference Text is not provided, so we need to use a common range seen in clinical practice.
   - A normal bilirubin level is typically around 0.3 to 1.2 mg/dL. Since the patient is critically ill, the bilirubin level may be elevated.

5. map_pressure:
   - The mean arterial pressure (MAP) is the average pressure in a patient's arteries during one cardiac cycle.
   - The Reference Text provides a BP of 120/80 mmHg, which we can use to calculate the MAP.
   - MAP can be calculated as [(2 * Diastolic BP) + Systolic BP] / 3.
   - Therefore, we can calculate the MAP based on the provided blood pressure values.

6. vasoactive_agents:
   - The vasoactive_agents parameter indicates the level of vasoactive agents being used to support the patient's blood pressure in the ICU.
   - The Reference Text does not explicitly mention the vasoactive agents being used.
   - We can assume an initial value for vasoactive_agents based on the patient's critical condition and the need for supportive measures in the ICU.

7. creatinine:
   - The serum creatinine level is provided in the Reference Text as part of the biochemical profile.
   - The specific value for creatinine is not provided, so we need to use a common range seen in clinical practice.
   - A normal creatinine level is approximately 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dL, but in critically ill patients, the creatinine level may be higher.

8. urine_output:
   - The Reference Text does not provide the specific urine output for the patient.
   - A normal urine output for an adult is around 0.5 to 1 mL/kg/hour, but in critically ill patients, this can vary significantly.
   - Given the patient's critical condition, we can assume a urine output value that reflects the potential for renal dysfunction.

9. o2_delivery_type:
   - The type of oxygen delivery method used is described by the o2_delivery_type parameter.
   - The Reference Text does not specify the exact oxygen delivery method.
   - We can assume an initial value for o2_delivery_type based on common oxygen delivery methods used in the ICU.

10. o2_flow_rate:
    - The flow rate of oxygen delivery is provided in the Reference Text as the patient's oxygen support.
    - The specific value for the oxygen flow rate is not provided, so we need to assume a common value based on typical oxygen therapy practices in the ICU.
