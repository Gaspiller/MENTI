2025-08-14 00:58:33,849 - INFO - 1. Identify the user demand: The user is asking which tool is used to assess the patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).

2. Review the detailed information of each tool in the Tool List to find the tool that calculates the Mean Arterial Pressure.

3. From the detailed information provided, the tool used to calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" tool.

4. Choose the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" tool from the Tool List as it directly addresses the user demand for assessing the patient's Mean Arterial Pressure.

Final Answer: 
```json
{
    "chosen_tool_name": "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)"
}

2025-08-14 00:58:35,889 - INFO - 1. Based on the Reference Text, the systolic blood pressure (SBP) is 145 mmHg and the diastolic blood pressure (DBP) is 90 mmHg.
2. Since there are no specific mentions of other values related to MAP calculation, we will use the SBP and DBP values provided in the text to calculate MAP using the formula: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.

Parameters List:
```json
{
    "systolic_bp": {"Value": 145, "Unit": "mmHg"},
    "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 90, "Unit": "mmHg"}
}

2025-08-14 00:58:39,874 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies. The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.

Parameters:
systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.

Returns:
float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.

Example:
>>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
93.33333333333333

Parameter Listï¼š
{
    "systolic_bp": {"Value": 145, "Unit": "mmHg"},
    "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 90, "Unit": "mmHg"}
}

Step By Step Analysis:
For systolic_bp:
1. Function Docstring requires the systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
2. Parameter List provides the systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
3. The units match, so no unit conversion is needed.

For diastolic_bp:
1. Function Docstring requires the diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
2. Parameter List provides the diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
3. The units match, so no unit conversion is needed.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use mmHg as the unit."
}
