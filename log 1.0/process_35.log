2025-08-14 00:42:56,996 - INFO - 1. Parameter: nervous
   - Reference Text: The patient is described as feeling restless, having trouble relaxing, and being irritable. These symptoms align with feelings of nervousness, anxiety, or being on edge, which are assessed by the nervous parameter in the GAD-7 score.
   - Inference: Since the patient displayed symptoms of restlessness and irritability, the score for feeling nervous can be inferred to be around 2.
   - Value: 2

2. Parameter: control_worrying
   - Reference Text: The patient mentioned not being able to stop worrying, which corresponds to the control_worrying parameter in the GAD-7 score.
   - Inference: The patient's description indicates a moderate level of worry, so the score for not being able to control worrying can be inferred to be around 2.
   - Value: 2

3. Parameter: worry_too_much
   - Reference Text: The text mentions the patient worrying about work-related injustices and trivial matters, hinting at excessive worry.
   - Inference: Based on the patient's concerns about various issues, the score for worrying too much about different things can be inferred to be around 2.
   - Value: 2

4. Parameter: trouble_relaxing
   - Reference Text: It is specifically stated in the clinical history that the patient finds it difficult to relax.
   - Inference: The clear indication of trouble relaxing implies a significant issue in this area.
   - Value: 3

5. Parameter: restlessness
   - Reference Text: The patient displays symptoms of restlessness, making it hard to sit still.
   - Inference: The restlessness described aligns with the restlessness parameter in the GAD-7 score.
   - Value: 3

6. Parameter: irritability
   - Reference Text: The patient exhibits irritability, becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
   - Inference: Given the patient's irritability and threats of harming oneself, the score for irritability can be inferred to be around 2.
   - Value: 2

7. Parameter: fear_of_awful_events
   - Reference Text: The text mentions the patient feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.
   - Inference: The patient's fear of being controlled and harmed suggests a sense of impending danger.
   - Value: 3

This function computes the total score based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days, 2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings to assess and monitor treatment responses.

Parameters:
- nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
- control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
- worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
- trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
- restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
- irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
- fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

Returns:
int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

Usage Example:
