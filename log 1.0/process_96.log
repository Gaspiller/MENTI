2025-08-14 01:23:34,867 - INFO - 1. elevated_risk_surgery:
There is no direct mention of the type of surgery the patient is undergoing in the Reference Text. We can infer that the patient is not undergoing intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular surgery based on the absence of these details. Thus, we can assume that elevated_risk_surgery is False.

2. history_of_ischemic_heart_disease:
The patient's past medical history does not mention any history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, nitrate therapy, or ECG showing pathological Q waves. Therefore, we can assume that history_of_ischemic_heart_disease is False.

3. history_of_congestive_heart_failure:
There is no explicit mention of signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales, S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray findings indicative of congestive heart failure in the Reference Text. Hence, we can infer that history_of_congestive_heart_failure is False.

4. history_of_cerebrovascular_disease:
There is no mention of a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke in the patient's history. Therefore, we can assume that history_of_cerebrovascular_disease is False.

5. preop_treatment_with_insulin:
The Reference Text does not provide any information on the patient being treated with insulin pre-operatively. Hence, we can infer that preop_treatment_with_insulin is False.

6. preop_creatinine_above_threshold:
The text states that the patient's pre-operative creatinine levels are normal. As a result, we can infer that preop_creatinine_above_threshold is False.

2025-08-14 01:23:43,384 - INFO - {{"Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
