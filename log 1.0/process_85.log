2025-08-14 01:15:51,330 - INFO - 1. Based on the User Demand, the tool needed to evaluate the preoperative risk for cardiac surgery patients.

2. Looking at the Tool List, the most suitable tool is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

3. This tool is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery, which aligns with the user demand for evaluating preoperative cardiac risk.

4. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index calculates the total score based on specific risk factors such as elevated risk surgery, history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, preoperative treatment with insulin, and preoperative creatinine levels.

5. By considering the scenario provided, where the patient has a diagnosis of 21-trisomy syndrome and the decision for induced abortion due to high-risk factors, it is essential to assess the cardiac risk in such a patient before any surgical intervention.

6. The absence of chronic conditions or significant medical issues, along with normal blood creatinine levels, indicates a need for a preoperative risk assessment to ensure the safety of the patient during the procedure.

7. Therefore, the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" is the most appropriate tool to evaluate the patient's cardiac risk before any surgical procedures.

2025-08-14 01:15:58,386 - INFO - 1. elevated_risk_surgery (bool):
   - There is no direct mention of the type of surgery in the Reference Text. However, based on the lack of mention of specific surgical procedures and the absence of clear risk factors related to intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular surgeries in the text, we can infer that the surgery in this case is not of elevated risk.
   - Therefore, the value for elevated_risk_surgery is False.

2. history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool):
   - There is no explicit mention of a history of ischemic heart disease in the Reference Text. However, considering the patient's age (37 years old) and the absence of any specific symptoms or risk factors related to ischemic heart disease, we can infer that there is no history of ischemic heart disease.
   - Therefore, the value for history_of_ischemic_heart_disease is False.

3. history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool):
   - There is no clear indication of signs of congestive heart failure in the Reference Text. Given the absence of symptoms related to congestive heart failure such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales, S3 gallop, or paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, we can infer that there is no history of congestive heart failure.
   - Therefore, the value for history_of_congestive_heart_failure is False.

4. history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool):
   - The Reference Text does not mention any history of cerebrovascular disease. Since there is no indication of transient ischemic attack or stroke in the text, we can infer that there is no history of cerebrovascular disease.
   - Therefore, the value for history_of_cerebrovascular_disease is False.

5. preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool):
   - The Reference Text states "术前未使用胰岛素治疗," which translates to "no preoperative use of insulin treatment." This indicates that the patient is not being treated with insulin preoperatively.
   - Therefore, the value for preop_treatment_with_insulin is False.

6. preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool):
   - The Reference Text mentions "47，XN,+21肌酐正常," which translates to "47, XN, +21 creatinine normal." Since the creatinine level is normal, which is below the threshold of greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L, we can infer that pre-operative creatinine levels are not above the threshold.
   - Therefore, the value for preop_creatinine_above_threshold is False.

2025-08-14 01:16:03,636 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
