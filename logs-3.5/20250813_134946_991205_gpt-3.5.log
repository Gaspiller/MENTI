[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估该患者肝纤维化的严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和辅助检查结果，可以推测患者可能患有肝癌，肺癌（小细胞癌），脾胃胆囊疾病等疾病。肝占位可能导致右胁部胀痛加重，而肝内实质性低密度影多发，密度不均，结合免疫组化标记结果显示有恶性肿瘤倾向；肺部病理活检显示右上叶开口肉芽增生，肺功能不全导致右肺不张，肺阻塞性疾病等病变。这些病变可能导致腹部压痛，消化系统功能障碍等症状。综合来看，患者的肝肺功能可能受到一定的影响。需进一步诊断和治疗。
