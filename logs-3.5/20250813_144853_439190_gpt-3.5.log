[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估非心脏手术后心脏并发症的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病历信息，患者主要出现右侧膝关节外伤疼痛、肿胀和活动受限，临床诊断为右侧髌骨骨折。治疗方案包括右坐骨神经阻滞加右髂筋膜加股神经阻滞，且病情好转。此外，患者还被诊断为冠心病心功能Ⅱ级，心脏彩超显示左心功能减低，BNP水平升高。

根据病历内容，可以推测患者可能存在以下问题：
1. 膝关节功能受限和疼痛：由于右侧髌骨骨折导致的外伤。
2. 冠心病心功能不全：心脏彩超显示左心功能减低，BNP水平升高可能提示心脏负荷过重。
3. 原发性房室传导阻滞：EKG示一度房室传导阻滞。

需要注意患者的心血管健康状况和骨折恢复过程，以保证患者安全和良好的康复。
