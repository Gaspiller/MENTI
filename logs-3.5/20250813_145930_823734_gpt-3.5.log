You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者肺炎的严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:
1. The patient presented with a fever for 3 days, cough for 2 days, and one episode of seizure. This indicates an acute upper respiratory tract infection with febrile seizure.
2. The patient was diagnosed with Mycoplasma pneumoniae infection, viral rash, and febrile seizure.
3. Treatment with intravenous antiviral medication and fluid therapy resulted in improvement in the patient's condition.
4. The patient has a history of good health with previous vaccinations up to date.
5. The physical examination revealed a slightly decreased mental status, but clear consciousness, tachycardia, tachypnea, and low blood pressure.
6. The lab results show normal white blood cell count, low hemoglobin level, normal platelet count, low CRP level, and normal BUN level.

Impaired bodily functions:
1. Central nervous system function may be impaired as evidenced by the febrile seizure experienced by the patient.
2. The patient's decreased mental status and febrile seizure indicate potential neurological involvement.
3. Respiratory function may also be impaired due to the presence of cough and chest congestion.
Overall, the patient's condition is likely due to the viral infection affecting multiple systems, including the respiratory and neurological systems.
