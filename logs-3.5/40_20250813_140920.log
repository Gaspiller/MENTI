2. The patient in the scenario is presenting with impaired neurological function due to acute carbon monoxide poisoning, which can affect consciousness and neurological status.

3. The NIHSS is specifically designed to assess patients with stroke or suspected stroke, providing a detailed assessment of various neurological functions and deficits.

4. In this case, the NIHSS can be used to quantify the severity of the patient's neurological impairment, including level of consciousness, motor function, sensory deficits, and language abilities.

5. By utilizing the NIHSS, healthcare providers can track the patient's neurological status, monitor changes over time, and guide treatment decisions in cases of acute neurological emergencies like carbon monoxide poisoning.

2025-08-13 14:10:23,701 - INFO - Step By Step Analysis:
1. nausea_vomiting:
   In the reference text, there is no specific mention of nausea or vomiting. We will infer a value based on the absence of these symptoms, so we will assign:
   - Value: 0

2. tremor:
   There is no information about tremors in the reference text, so we will assume the absence of tremors.
   - Value: 0

3. paroxysmal_sweats:
   The reference text does not provide information about sweating symptoms, so we will assume the absence of significant sweating.
   - Value: 0

4. anxiety:
   The reference text does not mention anxiety levels, so we will consider a low level of anxiety.
   - Value: 1

5. agitation:
   As per the reference text, we do not have any indication of agitation. We will assign a minimal value for agitation.
   - Value: 0

6. tactile_disturbances:
   There is no mention of tactile disturbances in the reference text, so we will assume there are none.
   - Value: 0

7. visual_disturbances:
   Similar to tactile disturbances, no information is provided about visual disturbances in the reference text. Hence, we will assume minimal visual disturbances.
   - Value: 0

8. headache_fullness:
   The reference text does not specify any headache or fullness in the head symptoms. Therefore, we will assume no significant headache.
   - Value: 0

9. orientation_sensorium:
   The reference text talks about a mismatch in the loc_alertness value, but this parameter is not defined in the Function Docstring. Since there is no direct relation to orientation or clouding of sensorium, we will randomly assign a value for this parameter based on the given ranges in the Function Docstring.
   - Value: 2

{{"Calculate the CIWA-Ar scale score for assessing alcohol withdrawal severity.

    The CIWA-Ar scale is intended for use in various medical settings where alcohol withdrawal is suspected.
    This tool helps in quantifying the severity of alcohol withdrawal through several symptom dimensions,
    each scored independently. The cumulative score helps guide clinical decisions regarding the necessity
    and intensity of treatment for withdrawal.

    Parameters:
    nausea_vomiting (int): Index for nausea and vomiting severity. Range: 0-7.
