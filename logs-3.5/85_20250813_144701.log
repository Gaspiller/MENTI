2025-08-13 14:47:17,956 - INFO - 1. Based on the provided patient's case, the main focus is on assessing the patient's postoperative risk. The patient is a 79-year-old male retiree with lung cancer and metastasis to the spine, presenting with symptoms of cough and back pain. This scenario requires evaluating the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications due to the underlying lung cancer and potential spinal cord involvement.

2. The most suitable tool from the tool list to assess the postoperative risk in this patient scenario is the "ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications." This tool specifically helps predict the risk of pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery under different types of anesthesia, which aligns with the need to evaluate the postoperative risk in the case of the patient with lung cancer and spinal metastasis.

3. By utilizing the ARISCAT Score tool, healthcare providers can input the relevant parameters such as the patient's age, preoperative oxygen saturation, presence of respiratory infection, anemia, surgical incision type, surgery duration, and emergency procedure status to calculate the ARISCAT score.

4. The calculated ARISCAT score will provide a summation of points based on the patient's specific parameters, giving an indication of the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in this case.
