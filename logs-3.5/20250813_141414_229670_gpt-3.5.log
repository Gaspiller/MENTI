You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}
Step By Step Analysis:
{{Here is your step-by-step analysis.}}
Parameters List:

    "weight": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "kg"},
    "height": {"Value": 175, "Unit": "cm"}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.
    
    Parameters:
    - hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
    - bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

    Returns:
    - int: Glasgow-Blatchford Score, ranging from 0 to 23.

    This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. hemoglobin:
   - From the reference text, the patient's hemoglobin level is mentioned as 77g/L and later as 67g/L.
   - Since the most recent value is 67g/L, we will consider this as the patient's hemoglobin level.

2. bun:
   - The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of the patient is not explicitly mentioned in the reference text.
   - Based on the clinical diagnosis of a gastrointestinal bleeding patient, we can assume that the BUN level might be affected. Let's assign a random value for BUN.

3. systolic_bp:
   - The patient's initial systolic blood pressure is mentioned as 117/76mmHg.
   - In this case, the systolic blood pressure is 117mmHg, so we will consider this as the patient's systolic blood pressure.

4. sex:
   - The patient is identified as male in the reference text, so the sex parameter should be filled with 1 to indicate male.

5. heart_rate:
   - The patient's heart rate is mentioned as 100 beats per minute.
   - Since it is specified that heart rate ≥100 per minute should be indicated as 1, we will assign a value of 1 for heart_rate.

6. melena:
   - Melena is mentioned as present for the patient, so we will assign a value of 1 to indicate yes.

7. syncope:
   - The reference text states that there has been recent syncope.
   - Since recent syncope should be indicated as 2, we will assign a value of 2 for syncope.

8. hepatic_disease:
   - There is mention of a history of hepatic disease for the patient.
   - As the patient has a history of hepatic disease, we will assign a value of 2 to denote yes.

9. cardiac_failure:
   - The reference text does not indicate the presence of cardiac failure for the patient.
   - Since there is no mention of cardiac failure, we will assign a value of 0 to indicate no presence of cardiac failure.
