You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于预测患者在接受冠状动脉造影术+左心导管术后6周内发生重大心脏不良事件的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:
1. The patient has a history of X syndrome, acute bronchitis, peptic ulcer, post-traumatic brain sequelae, and chronic otitis media.
2. Presenting symptoms include recurrent dyspnea, chest tightness, and recent onset of headache.
3. The patient's past medical history includes hypertension, chronic otitis media, traumatic brain injury, and nerve damage in the left arm.
4. The physical examination shows normal vital signs, normal heart sounds, clear lung sounds, and no abdominal tenderness or swelling.
5. The patient's electrocardiogram is normal.

Speculated Impairments:
1. Impairment in cardiovascular system due to the history of X syndrome, acute bronchitis, peptic ulcer, and chest tightness, with the need for coronary angiography and left heart catheterization.
2. Possible neurological impairment from the post-traumatic brain sequelae and nerve damage in the left arm.

Further investigation and monitoring of cardiovascular and neurological functions are recommended for this patient.
