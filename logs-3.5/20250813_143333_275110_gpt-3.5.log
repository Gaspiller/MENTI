[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者社区获得性肺炎的严重程度指数？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和辅助检查结果，患者主要表现为咳嗽咳痰伴发热，胸片提示支气管肺炎，血常规显示白细胞计数偏高，中性粒细胞占比偏高，这可能表明患者存在一种炎症性疾病。此外，患者的氧分压在正常范围内，排除了氧合障碍的可能性。

根据上述情况，患者可能存在呼吸道感染导致的支气管肺炎，炎症反应引起的白细胞增高和中性粒细胞占比偏高。治疗上应注意控制感染，缓解炎症，保持呼吸道通畅，及时给予抗生素治疗。
