You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

    Calculate the NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS).

    The NIHSS helps physicians quantify the severity of a stroke in the acute setting. 
    Increasing scores indicate a more severe stroke and correlate with the size of the infarction on both CT and MRI evaluation.
    Scores assessed within the first 48 hours following a stroke have been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes at the 3-month and 1-year mark.

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Analyze parameter `loc_alertness`:
   - Reference Text: The text does not provide clear information regarding the patient's alertness level based on the defined scoring criteria.
   - Inference: Since the patient is unconscious and unresponsive, the appropriate score for `loc_alertness` would be the highest value, which is 3 (Postures or unresponsive).

2. Analyze parameter `loc_questions`:
   - Reference Text: The text does not mention the patient's ability to answer questions related to the month and age.
   - Inference: Considering the patient's state of unconsciousness, the appropriate score for `loc_questions` would be the highest value, which is 2 (None right).

3. Analyze parameter `loc_commands`:
   - Reference Text: Unable to determine the patient's ability to perform tasks such as blinking eyes and squeezing hands.
   - Inference: Given the lack of response to stimuli, the appropriate score for `loc_commands` would be the highest value, which is 2 (Performs none).

4. Analyze parameter `horizontal_gaze`:
   - Reference Text: The text does not provide specific information about the patient's horizontal gaze.
   - Inference: Since the patient's condition does not indicate any issues with eye movements, the appropriate score for `horizontal_gaze` would be 0 (Normal).

5. Analyze parameter `visual_fields`:
   - Reference Text: There is no mention of visual field abnormalities in the patient.
   - Inference: Considering the lack of information, the appropriate score for `visual_fields` would be 0 (No loss).

6. Analyze parameter `facial_palsy`:
   - Reference Text: The text does not describe any facial palsy symptoms in the patient.
   - Inference: Based on the absence of information, the appropriate score for `facial_palsy` would be 0 (Normal).

7. Analyze parameter `left_arm_motor_drift`, `right_arm_motor_drift`, `left_leg_motor_drift`, and `right_leg_motor_drift`:
   - Reference Text: No specific information provided regarding motor drift in the patient's limbs.
   - Inference: Due to the lack of details, assign a score of 0 (No drift) for all limb motor drift parameters.

8. Analyze parameter `limb_ataxia`:
   - Reference Text: There is no mention of limb ataxia in the patient.
   - Inference: Given the absence of information, assign a score of 0 (No ataxia) for `limb_ataxia`.

9. Analyze parameter `sensation`:
   - Reference Text: No clear details on the patient's sensation status.
   - Inference: Considering the patient's unresponsiveness, assign a score of 2 (Complete loss) for `sensation`.

10. Analyze parameter `language_aphasia`:
   - Reference Text: The text does not provide information about the patient's language/aphasia status.
   - Inference: Based on the lack of details, assign a score of 0 (Normal) for `language_aphasia`.

11. Analyze parameter `dysarthria`:
    - Reference Text: There is no mention of dysarthria symptoms in the patient.
    - Inference: Since the patient is unresponsive, assign a score of 0 (Normal) for `dysarthria`.

12. Analyze parameter `extinction_inattention`:
    - Reference Text: No specific information available about extinction/inattention in the patient.
    - Inference: In the absence of details, assign a score of 0 (No abnormality) for `extinction_inattention`.
