Tool List: {{['Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa)', 'Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity', 'Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia', 'Free Water Deficit in Hypernatremia', 'Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA)', 'Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk', 'CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia: Calculate the Corrected Sodium for Hyperglycemia using Hillier's method from 1999.

    This function computes the corrected sodium level in patients with hyperglycemia,
    accounting for osmotic shifts of water from the intracellular to the extracellular space,
    which can lead to dilutional hyponatremia. The formula uses a correction factor of 2.4 mEq/L
    for every 100 mg/dL increase in serum glucose above the normal threshold of 100 mg/dL.

    Parameters:
        measured_sodium (float): The measured sodium level in mEq/L.
        serum_glucose (float): The serum glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
        float: The corrected sodium level in mEq/L.

    Example:
        >>> sodium_correction_hyperglycemia(140, 200)
        142.4

Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score: "Calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score which is used to assess the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.
The score is used to track a patient's status during their stay in an intensive care unit to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.

- o2_flow_rate (float): Flow rate of oxygen delivery in L/min.

Returns:
int: Total SOFA score which is the sum of individual scores across the specified parameters."

Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa): Calculate the Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa) in percentage.
    
    The FENa is a clinical tool used to evaluate oliguria and/or acute kidney injury of unclear etiology. It is most
    accurate in patients with oliguric acute kidney injury who have not been treated with diuretics, do not have
    chronic kidney disease, urinary tract obstruction, or acute glomerular disease.
    
    Parameters:
    serum_creatinine (float): Serum creatinine concentration (mg/dL)
    urine_sodium (float): Urine sodium concentration (mmol/L)
    serum_sodium (float): Serum sodium concentration (mmol/L)
    urine_creatinine (float): Urine creatinine concentration (mg/dL)
    
    Returns:
    float: The Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa) in percentage
    
    Note:
    FENa is calculated using the formula:
    FENa (%) = 100 × (serum_creatinine × urine_sodium) / (serum_sodium × urine_creatinine)

Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity: Calculate the Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity using the Smithline-Gardner Formula.

    This function calculates the serum osmolality/osmolarity based on the concentrations of sodium, glucose,
    and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the blood. Serum osmolality is a measure of the solute concentration in the blood,
    and it can be used to assess the body's fluid and electrolyte balance. An osmolar gap (difference between measured
    and expected osmolality) greater than 10 can indicate the presence of certain toxic alcohols, mannitol, or propylene glycol.

    Note: At extreme levels of serum glucose, such as in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), the osmolar gap may be skewed,
    and clinical judgment should be used.

    Parameters:
    serum_na (float): Serum sodium concentration in mmol/L. Typical reference range is 135-145 mmol/L.
    serum_glucose (float): Serum glucose concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 70-100 mg/dL.
    serum_bun (float): Blood urea nitrogen concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 7-20 mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: Calculated serum osmolality in mOsm/kg.

    Formula:
    Serum Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 2 * (serum_na) + (serum_glucose / 18) + (serum_bun / 2.8)


Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia: Calculate the corrected calcium level in patients with suspected hypocalcemia
    who have low albumin levels. Hypocalcemia might not be apparent if serum albumin is low,
    thus this formula adjusts the calcium level based on albumin discrepancy.

    Args:
    normal_albumin (float): The normal albumin level in g/dL assumed for the calculation.
    patient_albumin (float): The patient's measured albumin level in g/dL.
    serum_ca (float): The patient's measured serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: The corrected serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Example:
    >>> corrected_calcium(4.0, 3.2, 8.5)
    8.84
 

Free Water Deficit in Hypernatremia: Calculate the Free Water Deficit (FWD) in a patient with hypernatremia.

    The FWD is a measure used in the management of hypernatremia to determine the amount
    of water a patient needs to ingest or be given intravenously to reach normal serum
    sodium levels without inducing cellular edema.

    Parameters:
    - gender_age_group (int): Index representing the patient's gender and age group.
      - 0: Adult male
      - 1: Adult female
      - 2: Elderly male

      - 4: Child
    - weight_kg (float): The weight of the patient in kilograms.
    - current_na (float): The current serum sodium level of the patient (mmol/L).
    - ideal_na (float): The target or ideal serum sodium level for the patient (mmol/L).

    Returns:
    - float: The calculated free water deficit in liters.

    Usage:
    Calculate the free water deficit for an elderly female weighing 70 kg with a current
    sodium level of 155 mmol/L and an ideal sodium level of 140 mmol/L:
    >>> calculate_free_water_deficit(3, 70, 155, 140)


Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA): Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA) using provided weight and height.

    BMI is a measure of body fat based on weight and height that applies to adult men and women.
    It can be misleading for very muscular individuals or in specific ethnic groups with different
    body compositions and statures.

    BSA is often used in medical settings to determine the dosages of medications that are more 
    accurately calculated using body surface area rather than weight.

    Parameters:
    - weight_kg (float): Weight of the individual in kilograms.
    - height_cm (float): Height of the individual in centimeters.

    Returns:
    - dict: Dictionary containing 'BMI' and 'BSA' with their respective values.

Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS): Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.
    
    Parameters:
    - hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
    - bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

    Returns:
    - int: Glasgow-Blatchford Score, ranging from 0 to 23.

    This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.


HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk: Calculate the HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.
    
    The HAS-BLED Score is used to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding and helps guide decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy.
    This scoring system can be considered alongside other bleeding risk scores or thromboembolic risk assessments to weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation.
