You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估酒精性肝硬化患者的肝功能程度和预后风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:
The patient presents with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, portal vein biliary disease leading to subacute liver failure. The main abnormality observed is the significantly elevated levels of total bilirubin (536.0μmol/L) and direct bilirubin (293.0μmol/L), indicating impaired liver function and obstructive jaundice. The presence of ascites and splenomegaly suggests portal hypertension. Additionally, the presence of multiple liver cysts, dilated intrahepatic bile ducts, and gallbladder inflammation with multiple stones further confirms the pre-existing liver pathology.

Speculated Impairments:
1. Impaired bile excretion due to obstructive jaundice from portal vein biliary disease.
2. Impaired liver synthetic function due to significantly elevated bilirubin levels.
3. Portal hypertension leading to ascites and splenomegaly.
4. Possible cholestatic liver damage indicated by elevated liver enzymes AST and ALT.

Further investigations and treatment, such as liver transplantation, are necessary to address the underlying liver dysfunction and complications.
