You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.
    
    The HAS-BLED Score is used to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding and helps guide decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy.
    This scoring system can be considered alongside other bleeding risk scores or thromboembolic risk assessments to weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation.

    Parameters:
    hypertension (bool): True if the patient has hypertension, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has renal disease (dialysis, transplant, or Cr >2.26 mg/dL), False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has liver disease (cirrhosis or bilirubin >2x normal with AST/ALT/AP >3x normal), False otherwise.
    stroke_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, False otherwise.
    major_bleeding_history (bool): True if the patient has had prior major bleeding or predisposition to bleeding, False otherwise.
    labile_inr (bool): True if the patient has labile INR (unstable/high INRs, time in therapeutic range <60%), False otherwise.
    elderly (bool): True if the patient is elderly (age >65), False otherwise.
    medication_risk (bool): True if the patient uses medication that predisposes to bleeding (aspirin, clopidogrel, NSAIDs), False otherwise.
    alcohol_usage (bool): True if the patient consumes alcohol significantly (≥8 drinks/week), False otherwise.

    Returns:
    int: The total HAS-BLED score, which is a sum of all applicable risk factors.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_has_bled_score(True, False, False, True, False, True, True, False, True)

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. hypertension (bool):
   - In the Reference Text, there is a mention of "high blood pressure" (高血压病), which indicates that the patient has hypertension.
   - Value: True

2. renal_disease (bool):
   - There is no explicit mention of renal disease in the Reference Text. However, since the patient has undergone dialysis in the past, it can be inferred that the patient has renal disease.
   - Value: True

3. liver_disease (bool):
   - The Reference Text does not provide explicit information about liver disease. Since there is no mention of liver issues, it can be assumed that the patient does not have liver disease.
   - Value: False

4. stroke_history (bool):
   - The Reference Text mentions a history of "old cerebral infarction" (陈旧性脑梗死), indicating a previous stroke.
   - Value: True

5. major_bleeding_history (bool):
   - Although there is no direct mention of major bleeding history in the Reference Text, the patient's current condition includes upper gastrointestinal bleeding (上消化道出血), which can be considered prior major bleeding.
   - Value: True

6. labile_inr (bool):
   - There is no specific mention of labile INR or unstable/high INRs in the Reference Text. Since it is not explicitly stated, the assumption can be made that the patient does not have labile INR.
   - Value: False

7. elderly (bool):
   - The patient's age is mentioned as 54 years, which does not meet the criteria for being considered elderly (>65 years).
   - Value: False

8. medication_risk (bool):
   - There is no direct reference to medications predisposing to bleeding (aspirin, clopidogrel, NSAIDs) in the Reference Text. Since it is not mentioned, it can be assumed that the patient does not use such medication.
   - Value: False
  
9. alcohol_usage (bool):
   - The Reference Text does not specify the patient's alcohol consumption level (≥8 drinks/week).
   - Given the lack of information, the assumption can be made that the patient's alcohol consumption is not significant.
   - Value: False
