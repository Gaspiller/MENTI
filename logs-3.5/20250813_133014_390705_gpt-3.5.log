[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的肾小球滤过率？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病例信息，患者表现出右肾萎缩，左肾积水，左侧输尿管末端结石，肾周渗出等症状，提示泌尿系感染及慢性肾衰竭急性加重。此外，还出现了扩张型心肌病心衰3度，心包积液，心律失常，肺气肿，肺部感染，凝血功能异常，高血压等多系统并发症。根据这些异常表现，推测患者的泌尿系统功能、心肌功能、肺部功能和凝血功能可能受到影响。治疗方案中提到了输尿管镜下钬激光碎石术，旨在治疗输尿管结石，可能有助于改善部分泌尿系统功能。综合来看，患者整体情况危急，需要全面治疗以维持重要器官功能。
