[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估HBV患者的肝脏纤维化程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的患者病历信息，可以看出患者有腹痛的主诉，并且伴有肩背部胀痛不适，呈刀割样疼痛。辅助检查显示腹部CT口头报告考虑空腔脏器穿孔，腹部平片提示膈下游离气体，提示空腔脏器穿孔。同时，血液检查显示白细胞计数升高，中性细胞比率和数目增加，CRP升高。

根据以上信息，可以初步推断患者可能存在腹腔内空腔脏器穿孔的情况，可能影响肝、肾功能，引起炎症反应和感染。进一步的治疗可能包括手术修复穿孔部位，抗炎、抗感染治疗以及重点监测肝、肾功能等。
