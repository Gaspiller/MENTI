[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于计算患者的平均动脉压（MAP）？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和临床表现，可以确定患者患有穿透性心脏损伤和急性心脏压塞。穿透性心脏损伤可能导致心包积液和心脏压塞，从而引起心前后壁之间的液性暗区。治疗方面，患者接受了全身麻醉下的心脏裂口修补术，且病情有所好转。

可能受损的功能包括心脏收缩和舒张功能，心脏的泵血功能受损以及可能存在心脏压塞引起的心脏功能障碍。另外，贫血也可能对心脏功能产生额外的影响。治疗上需要密切关注心脏的功能状态及血液循环情况，维持患者的循环稳定。
