You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估患者的肾小球滤过率？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病例资料，患者主诉双下肢水肿，伴有乏力、眼睑浮肿、心慌、喘气等症状，经检查发现肌酐、尿酸升高，尿常规出现葡萄糖、蛋白异常，肾功能受损。同时，检查结果显示患者存在肝脂肪变性，心脏瓣膜返流，以及多个脑部异常，如脑梗塞、白质脑病、脑萎缩等。这些异常表明患者存在慢性肾衰竭代偿期，可能导致肾功能不全，引起水电解质紊乱和代谢异常，进而影响心脏、肝脏等器官功能，同时还可能导致脑部血液供应不足与神经损伤。治疗结果显示病情好转，但仍需密切监测肾功能、心脏功能、神经系统状况等，采取相应治疗措施以维持稳定状态。
