[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估患者在子宫肌瘤剔除术前的心脏风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病历资料，可以看出患者患有子宫肌瘤和子宫内膜不规则增生的疾病。在手术治疗过程中，患者接受了VVI型心脏起搏器安置术后剔除子宫肌瘤的麻醉处理。这表明患者可能存在心律失常或心脏功能问题，需要心脏起搏器的辅助。同时，子宫肌瘤和子宫内膜不规则增生可能对生殖系统功能造成影响，如月经周期不规律、月经过多等问题。在手术治疗后，病情有所缓解，但仍需要进一步关注心脏和生殖系统功能的影响。
