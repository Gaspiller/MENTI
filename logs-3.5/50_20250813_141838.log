2025-08-13 14:18:54,344 - INFO - 1. 根据用户需求，用户需要使用一个量表来预测患者在6周内发生重大心脏不良事件的风险。

2. 收集到的病历信息显示患者患有III度房室传导阻滞，高血压病和高脂血症。这些病史表明患者存在心血管疾病的风险因素。

3. 由于 III度房室传导阻滞可以引起心律失常，结合高血压和高脂血症的风险因素，需要一种评估心脏不良事件风险的量表。

4. 根据提供的工具列表，最适合用于此任务场景的量表是 "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"。

2025-08-13 14:18:59,008 - INFO - 1. Extract the history_score parameter:
   - Based on the reference text, the patient has a history of high blood pressure and hyperlipidemia, which can be considered as risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the history_score should be set to 2 (Highly suspicious) according to the scoring standards.
   
2. Extract the ekg_score parameter:
   - The reference text does not provide clear information on the EKG findings. We need to infer this parameter based on common symptoms associated with III-degree atrioventricular block, which can be considered as a significant rhythm disturbance. Therefore, the ekg_score should be set to 2 (Significant ST deviation) according to the scoring standards.
   
3. Extract the age_score parameter:
   - The reference text mentions that the patient is 54 years old. According to the scoring standards, an age between 45 and 64 corresponds to a score of 1. Therefore, the age_score should be set to 1.
   
4. Extract the risk_factors_score parameter:
   - The reference text indicates that the patient has a history of high blood pressure for 5 years and hyperlipidemia, which are considered cardiovascular risk factors. Additionally, there is a mention of high-risk factors in the clinical diagnosis. Therefore, the risk_factors_score should be set to 2.
   
5. Extract the troponin_score parameter:
   - The reference text does not provide specific information on the troponin levels. We will infer this parameter based on the description of the patient's stable condition and lack of acute symptoms. Given the lack of elevated troponin levels, we can assume that the troponin_score is 0 (≤ normal limit) according to the scoring standards.

2025-08-13 14:19:10,395 - INFO - {{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Args:
history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
    0 = Slightly suspicious,
    1 = Moderately suspicious,
    2 = Highly suspicious.
ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
    0 = Normal,
    1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
    2 = Significant ST deviation.
age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
    0 = less than 45,
    1 = between 45 and 64,
    2 = 65 or older.
risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
    0 = No known risk factors,
    1 = 1–2 risk factors,
    2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
    0 = ≤ normal limit,
    1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
    2 = >3 times normal limit.

Returns:
int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
     in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
     0-3 points indicate low risk,
     4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
     7-10 points indicate high risk.

Example:
>>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
