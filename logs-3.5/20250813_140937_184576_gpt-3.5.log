You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS)', 'Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS)', 'PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP', 'STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis', 'HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7)', 'APACHE II Score']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS): 
    Calculate the NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS).

    The NIHSS helps physicians quantify the severity of a stroke in the acute setting. 
    Increasing scores indicate a more severe stroke and correlate with the size of the infarction on both CT and MRI evaluation.
    Scores assessed within the first 48 hours following a stroke have been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes at the 3-month and 1-year mark.

Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS): Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.

PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9): Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.

    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
    It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

    This score is useful for patients undergoing preoperative evaluation but should not be used if a patient
    has already been diagnosed with OSA or uses CPAP at night. It helps in identifying patients who might have

Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.

    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.
 

HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events:  Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7


GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7): Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
    based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,

User Demand: {{哪一个量表被用于评估患者昏迷程度和神志状态的严重度？}}
Task Scenario: {{Analysis:
The patient's presentation of consciousness impairment, found unconscious on the floor with a burning coal stove nearby, and the subsequent diagnosis of acute carbon monoxide poisoning suggest that the patient may be experiencing impaired neurological function due to the toxic effects of carbon monoxide on the brain.

Given the patient's history of hypertension and current medication with amlodipine for blood pressure control, there is a possibility of underlying cardiovascular issues that may have predisposed the patient to the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning. This could indicate impairment in cardiovascular function.

The physical examination findings of pale lips, unresponsiveness to pain, and lack of cooperation further support the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning affecting the central nervous system and potentially impairing sensory and motor functions.

Overall, the abnormal parts of the patient's case point towards impaired neurological and cardiovascular functions as a result of acute carbon monoxide poisoning.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. The tool used to assess the severity of a stroke in the acute setting, quantify the level of consciousness, and evaluate different neurological deficits is the NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS).

2. The patient in the scenario is presenting with impaired neurological function due to acute carbon monoxide poisoning, which can affect consciousness and neurological status.

3. The NIHSS is specifically designed to assess patients with stroke or suspected stroke, providing a detailed assessment of various neurological functions and deficits.

4. In this case, the NIHSS can be used to quantify the severity of the patient's neurological impairment, including level of consciousness, motor function, sensory deficits, and language abilities.

5. By utilizing the NIHSS, healthcare providers can track the patient's neurological status, monitor changes over time, and guide treatment decisions in cases of acute neurological emergencies like carbon monoxide poisoning.
