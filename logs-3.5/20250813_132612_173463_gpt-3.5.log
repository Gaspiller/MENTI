[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于计算患者的肾小球滤过率（GFR）？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和辅助检查结果，可以初步推断患者患有肾炎，表现为明显的水肿、肉眼血尿以及肌肉酸痛、乏力等症状。肾活检显示肾小球存在纤维细胞性新月体，肾小球分叶肿胀、系膜区增宽，同时免疫荧光显示多种免疫球蛋白在肾小球沉积。这些结果提示患者可能患有IgA肾病，该疾病会导致肾功能受损，表现为蛋白尿、血尿等症状，需要及时治疗以防止疾病进展和加重肾脏损伤。
