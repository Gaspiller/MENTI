[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的昏迷程度和神经系统功能？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和临床表现，初步诊断为颅内出血伴血肿形成导致意识障碍。高血压可能是造成颅内出血的诱发因子之一。该颅内出血可能导致呼吸困难、双瞳孔散大、对光反射消失等症状，影响患者的神经系统功能。进一步的神经系统检查和治疗措施需要紧急介入以减轻颅内压，预防进一步神经系统损伤。
