[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于预测患者在6周内发生重大心脏不良事件的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病历信息，患者被诊断为 III度房室传导阻滞，这是一种心电传导系统方面的异常。这种传导阻滞可能导致心脏的房室之间的信号传输出现问题，可能会引起心跳过缓或不规律等心律失常。此外，患者还被诊断为高血压病和高脂血症，这可能会增加患者患心血管疾病的风险。治疗后患者病情平稳，但可能需要长期的监测和管理以预防并发症。
