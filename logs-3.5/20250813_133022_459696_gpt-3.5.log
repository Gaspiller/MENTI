CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
    It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.

    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.
 

Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA): Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA) using provided weight and height.

    BMI is a measure of body fat based on weight and height that applies to adult men and women.
    It can be misleading for very muscular individuals or in specific ethnic groups with different
    body compositions and statures.

    BSA is often used in medical settings to determine the dosages of medications that are more 
    accurately calculated using body surface area rather than weight.

    Parameters:
    - weight_kg (float): Weight of the individual in kilograms.
    - height_cm (float): Height of the individual in centimeters.

    Returns:
    - dict: Dictionary containing 'BMI' and 'BSA' with their respective values.

Maintenance Fluids Calculations: Calculate the Maintenance Fluids rate using the "4-2-1" Rule.
    
    This function determines the intravenous (IV) fluid rate for patients who are not taking oral fluids,
    addressing needs such as vomiting, NPO status, dehydration, insensible losses, or third spacing. It uses
    a weight-based dosing method to ensure appropriate fluid volume according to patient's weight.
    
    Parameters:
    - weight (float): The weight of the patient in kilograms.
    
    Returns:
    - float: The calculated IV fluid rate in mL per hour.
    
    Usage:
    - This calculation is crucial in medical settings where accurate fluid replacement is necessary,
      particularly in settings where patients cannot intake fluids orally.
    
    Example:
    - calculate_maintenance_fluids(25)  # Calculates fluid rate for a 25 kg patient.

HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance): Calculate the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).

    The HOMA-IR is a clinical tool used to estimate insulin resistance (IR), which can be
    indicative of potential glucose intolerance and diabetes. It is particularly useful
    in scenarios where more invasive and time-consuming methods like the clamp measurement
    (considered the gold standard for measuring IR) are not feasible. Although the HOMA-IR
    provides a reasonable correlation with clamp measurements, it is less accurate on an
    individual basis, which suggests a need for caution in its clinical application and
    interpretation.

    Parameters:
    - fasting_insulin (float): The fasting insulin level in uIU/mL.
    - fasting_glucose (float): The fasting glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR score).

    Formula:
    HOMA-IR score = (fasting insulin * fasting glucose) / 405

Ideal Body Weight and Adjusted Body Weight: Calculate the Ideal Body Weight (IBW) and Adjusted Body Weight (ABW) based on height and gender.
    
    The IBW calculation uses the Devine formula, which is applicable for individuals who are at least 60 inches tall.
    For individuals shorter than 5 feet, the IBW is adjusted by subtracting 2-5 lbs for each inch below 60 inches.
    The ABW is used for obese patients where the actual body weight exceeds the IBW, calculated as:
    ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (actual body weight - IBW).
    
    Parameters:
        height_in_inches (int): The height of the individual in inches.
        actual_body_weight (float): The actual body weight of the individual in kilograms.
        gender (str): The gender of the individual ("male" or "female").

    Returns:
        list: A list containing the IBW and ABW in kilograms. If the individual is not obese, ABW is set equal to IBW.
