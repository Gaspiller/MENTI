You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估术前冠心病患者的术后心脏风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

Abnormal parts of the case:
1. The patient has a history of unstable angina and experienced sudden abdominal pain, possibly due to acute coronary syndrome.
2. The patient has been diagnosed with gastric ulcer, cardia inflammation, chronic atrophic gastritis with erosion, and unstable angina.

Speculated impaired bodily functions:
1. Impaired cardiovascular function due to the history of unstable angina and suspected acute coronary syndrome.
2. Impaired gastrointestinal function due to the diagnosis of gastric ulcer and chronic gastritis with erosion.

Further investigation and treatment are needed to manage the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal conditions in this patient.

    "What are the recommended evaluation tools to assess the postoperative cardiac risk in patients with a history of unstable angina and suspected acute coronary syndrome, along with gastrointestinal issues like gastric ulcer and chronic gastritis?",
    "Are there specific assessment measures for determining postoperative cardiac risk in patients with both cardiovascular challenges like unstable angina and gastrointestinal issues such as gastric ulcer and chronic gastritis with erosion?"
