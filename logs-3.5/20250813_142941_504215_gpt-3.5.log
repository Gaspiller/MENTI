[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估患者抑郁症的严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病历信息，患者被诊断为中重度抑郁，并出现了情绪低落、心烦、无故哭泣等症状。精神检查显示患者表现被动，生活能力下降，睡眠质量降低，同时出现自知力减退等症状。辅助检查未发现明显异常。因此，可以推测患者的情绪调节、睡眠功能以及认知功能可能受到影响。治疗方案中给予抗抑郁药物系统治疗，也符合中重度抑郁的治疗标准。
