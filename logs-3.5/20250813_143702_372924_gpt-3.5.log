[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的肺炎严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和辅助检查结果显示，患者存在两肺感染灶，部分间质性改变，双侧胸腔积液，右肺下叶肺大泡等肺部病变，同时心脏彩超显示左房扩大，左室舒张功能减低，心脏瓣膜功能异常。这些情况可能导致患者出现呼吸困难、咳嗽咳痰、咳血、胸痛等症状，说明患者的肺部和心脏功能可能受损，需要进一步治疗和管理。
