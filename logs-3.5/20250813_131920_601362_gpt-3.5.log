[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患儿咽炎是否由链球菌引起的可能性？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病史和辅助检查结果，患儿被诊断为支气管肺炎，中性粒细胞减少症和心肌损害。支气管肺炎导致呼吸道症状，如发热、嗓子呼噜音、咳嗽和痰鸣音。中性粒细胞减少症可能导致免疫功能下降，增加感染的风险。心肌损害可能引起心功能异常，尤其是返流现象。治疗方案中的抗感染药物、抗炎药物和对症治疗有助于缓解症状和改善疾病情况。治疗结果表明病情在好转，但需继续密切观察和治疗以防复发或并发症。
