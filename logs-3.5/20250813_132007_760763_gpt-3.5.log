You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
    - history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(75, 'female', True, True, True, True, True)
    9}}

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Age:
   - The age of the patient is not explicitly mentioned in the reference text. However, based on the clinical diagnosis information provided, the patient is described as an 89-year-old female.
   - Therefore, the age parameter can be inferred as 89 years.

2. Sex:
   - The sex of the patient is explicitly mentioned in the reference text as female.
   - Therefore, the sex parameter can be set as 'female'.

3. History of Congestive Heart Failure:
   - The reference text mentions a clinical diagnosis of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease and heart failure (心功能Ⅱ--Ⅲ级), indicating a history of heart failure.
   - Thus, the history_of_congestive_heart_failure parameter can be set as True.

4. History of Hypertension:
   - The reference text does not explicitly state a history of hypertension.
   - As the patient has coronary heart disease, which is commonly associated with hypertension, the history_of_hypertension parameter can be assumed as True.

5. History of Stroke/TIA/Thromboembolism:
   - The reference text mentions the patient has a history of ischemic heart disease (冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病), which may indicate a history of stroke or thromboembolism.
   - Therefore, the history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism parameter can be set as True.

6. History of Vascular Disease:
   - The reference text mentions a diagnosis of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, which includes vascular involvement.
   - Therefore, the history_of_vascular_disease parameter can be set as True.

7. History of Diabetes:
   - The reference text does not mention a history of diabetes.
   - As there is no explicit indication of diabetes in the text, the history_of_diabetes parameter can be set as False.
