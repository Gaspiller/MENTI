You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'Corrected QT Interval (QTc)', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events:  Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.


Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk: Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery.

    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.

    in patients with syncope or those receiving multiple QT-prolonging medications. A prolonged QT interval 
    can indicate a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This function corrects the QT interval to a heart rate 
    of 60 beats per minute, accounting for variations due to different heart rates.

    Parameters:
        qt_interval (float): The measured QT interval in milliseconds.
        heart_rate (float): The patient's heart rate in beats per minute.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表用于预测心脏事件的风险，特别是对于先天性心脏病患者？}}
Task Scenario: {{根据病例提供的信息，该患者主要存在先天性心脏病，房间隔缺损，三尖瓣关闭不全，右心增大，心包腔少量积液，心功能Ⅰ级（NYHA分级）等问题。由于房间隔缺损和三尖瓣轻度关闭不全，可能导致心脏内部血液的逆流和循环受阻，从而影响心脏的正常功能。此外，患者还伴有贫血和脾大的情况，可能与心脏问题引起的血液循环异常有关。因此，患者可能存在心脏功能不全、贫血、循环系统问题等方面的身体功能障碍。治疗方面，介入封堵术治疗取得了病情好转的效果。}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. 为了预测心脏事件的风险，特别是对于先天性心脏病患者，我们需要选择能够全面评估患者心脏事件风险的评分工具。给定的患者病例信息表明患者存在先天性心脏病，房间隔缺损，三尖瓣关闭不全等心脏问题，因此需要选择一个能够适用于这种特定情况的评分工具。

2. 在提供的工具列表中，适合用于预测心脏事件风险的工具包括HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events和Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)。然而，由于患者情况涉及心脏先天性问题，并非手术前的心脏风险评估，因此更适合选择HEART Score进行风险评估。

3. HEART Score针对急诊科（ED）患者胸痛的风险分层，可以评估患者的心脏事件风险并将其划分为低、中、高风险组。结合患者先天性心脏病，闭式缺损和三尖瓣问题，这个评分工具能够帮助确定患者可能面临的心脏事件风险水平。

4. 因此，最适合用于预测心脏事件风险的工具是HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events。
