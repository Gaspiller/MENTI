[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者患急性脑梗死后出现的静脉血栓栓塞风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者提供的病历信息，可以初步推断该患者患有急性脑梗死和大脑中动脉闭塞（左侧M1段）的情况。这两个诊断可以解释患者突发的右侧肢体无力伴意识障碍的症状。脑梗死和动脉闭塞可能导致脑部缺血，进而影响神经传导和肌肉收缩功能。因此，患者可能出现言语不利，神志昏睡，反应迟钝，肢体无力等症状。治疗结果显示病情好转，但其卵圆孔未闭也值得关注，可能对血液循环机制造成影响。
