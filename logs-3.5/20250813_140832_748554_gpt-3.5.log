[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估患者的意识状态和昏迷程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和体格检查，患者出现昏迷且伴有呕吐，没有药物或食物中毒的病史。辅助检查未发现明显的心脑血管问题，但血糖在正常范围，暗示可能不是因为高血糖导致的昏迷。肝功能、肾功能以及血液分析指标基本正常。外生殖器没有异常，四肢没有畸形，下肢没有浮肿，病理反射未引出。

基于上述分析，可以推测患者的昏迷可能与中枢神经系统相关，如脑部问题导致的，但具体原因还需要进一步的神经系统检查以及头颅影像学检查来确定。
