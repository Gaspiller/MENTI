2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with severe major depressive disorder without psychotic symptoms, exhibiting symptoms such as worsening mood, sleep disturbances, excessive worrying, feelings of hopelessness, suicidal ideation, motor impairment, cognitive impairment, and delusional thinking. The patient also shows refusal of treatment and lack of insight into their condition, along with MRI abnormalities in the frontal lobes and sinuses.

3. From the provided tool list, the most suitable tool for assessing the severity of depression in this patient would be the "PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)".

4. The PHQ-9 is specifically designed to diagnose depression and quantify the severity of depression symptoms based on the nine criteria for major depressive disorder. It covers a range of symptoms including mood, sleep, energy levels, appetite, self-image, concentration, activity level, and suicidal thoughts.

5. By using the PHQ-9, the healthcare provider can accurately assess the severity of the patient's depressive symptoms, track changes over time, and determine the appropriate management and treatment plan.

2025-08-11 23:58:48,962 - INFO - {{Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.
