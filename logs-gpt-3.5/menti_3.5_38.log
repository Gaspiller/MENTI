2025-08-11 23:37:42,132 - INFO - 1. 根据用户需求，用户需要一个用于评估患者的广泛性焦虑症状严重程度的量表，这涉及到识别和监测焦虑症状的工具。

2. 在给定的病历信息中，虽然提到了心脏神经官能症、冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病、胃炎和高血压等病史，但并未明确提到与广泛性焦虑症状相关的信息。因此，我们不需要考虑病历信息的具体内容而是要依据用户需求选择适当的工具。

3. 在工具列表中，与评估患者的焦虑症状相关的工具是"GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7)"。GAD-7用于评估患者的焦虑症状严重程度，根据七个项目的得分来评估不同焦虑症状的严重性，从而提供一个总体焦虑症状评分。

4. 基于用户需求和工具列表的匹配，我们选择"GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7)"作为最适合的工具。

2025-08-11 23:37:46,042 - INFO - 1. Analyze parameter "nervous":
   From the Reference Text, we can infer that the patient has been feeling nervous and anxious, which aligns with the scoring for the "nervous" parameter in the Function Docstring. The patient shows signs of anxiety, so we can assume a relatively high score for this parameter.
   
2. Analyze parameter "control_worrying":
   Although it is not explicitly mentioned in the Reference Text, we can infer that the patient's inability to stop or control worrying may be present, given the anxiety symptoms described. Thus, we can assign a moderate score to this parameter.

3. Analyze parameter "worry_too_much":
   The patient worrying too much about different things is not directly stated in the Reference Text. However, considering the overall anxiety symptoms presented by the patient, we can assume a moderate score for this parameter.

4. Analyze parameter "trouble_relaxing":
   The patient is described as having trouble relaxing, which directly correlates with the "trouble_relaxing" parameter in the Function Docstring. Therefore, we can assign a high score to this parameter.

5. Analyze parameter "restlessness":
   The description of the patient being restless and unable to sit still matches the "restlessness" parameter in the Function Docstring. Therefore, we can assume a high score for this parameter.

6. Analyze parameter "irritability":
   The patient is mentioned to be easily annoyed or irritable, indicating a presence of irritability. Consequently, we can attribute a high score to this parameter.

7. Analyze parameter "fear_of_awful_events":
   The patient is described as feeling afraid, suggesting a fear of awful events. This aligns with the "fear_of_awful_events" parameter in the Function Docstring, so we can assign a moderate score for this parameter.

2025-08-11 23:37:52,986 - INFO - {{Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
    based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
    2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

    This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
    including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
    It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
    to assess and monitor treatment responses.

    Parameters:
    - nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
    - control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
    - worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
    - trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
    - restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
    - irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
    - fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

    Returns:
    int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

    Usage Example:
    gad_7_score = calculate_gad_7(3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
    print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score
