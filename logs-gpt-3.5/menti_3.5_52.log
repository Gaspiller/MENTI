2025-08-11 23:48:50,952 - INFO - 1. The user demand requires a tool that is used to predict the risk of a patient experiencing major cardiac events within 6 weeks after undergoing coronary angiography and left heart catheterization.

2. Based on the user demand and task scenario analysis:
    - The patient has a complex medical history with systemic issues.
    - Presenting symptoms indicate acute coronary syndrome.
    - Past medical history includes hypertension and vascular and neurological issues.
    - Underwent coronary angiography and left heart catheterization for improvement.

3. Considering the patient's cardiovascular issues and the need to predict the risk of major cardiac events post-procedure, the most suitable tool from the tool list is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

4. The HEART Score assesses the risk of major cardiac events in patients with chest pain and can help risk-stratify individuals into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome.

2025-08-11 23:48:57,025 - INFO - 1. history_score (int):
- The patient's history includes symptoms of chest discomfort, dyspnea, and episodes of fever over the past 10 years, with recent exacerbation of symptoms including headache and chest tightness. The patient visited the clinic for treatment previously. The current presentation showed signs of ischemia on the electrocardiogram, suggesting acute coronary syndrome.
- Based on the suspiciousness of the patient's history and the symptoms described, we can infer that the history_score is 2 (Highly suspicious).

2. ekg_score (int):
- The electrocardiogram showed signs of myocardial ischemia, indicating non-specific repolarization disturbance.
- According to the EKG findings described, the ekg_score is 1 (Non-specific repolarization disturbance).

3. age_score (int):
- The patient is described as a 60-year-old male.
- Considering the patient's age, the age_score is 2 (65 or older).

4. risk_factors_score (int):
- The patient has a history of hypertension, chronic otitis media, head injury leading to neurological damage, and arm nerve damage. There is no mention of the exact number of cardiovascular risk factors.
- Based on the known risk factors mentioned in the text, we can infer that the risk_factors_score is 2 (3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease).

5. troponin_score (int):
- The text mentions that the patient's creatine kinase-MB levels are normal.
- Since there is no specific mention of troponin levels, we can assume the troponin_score is 0 (≤ normal limit).

2025-08-11 23:49:03,238 - INFO - {{Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
