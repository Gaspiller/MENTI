2025-08-11 23:47:17,756 - INFO - 1. The user demand specifies that we need to choose a tool to predict the risk of major cardiac events in patients within 6 weeks.
2. From the Tool List, the most suitable tool for predicting the risk of major cardiac events in this scenario is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."
3. The HEART Score calculates the risk of major cardiac events based on specific parameters such as history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels.
4. Given the patient's clinical diagnosis of left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired cardiac function, and treatment plan focused on managing heart failure symptoms, the HEART Score can help risk-stratify the patient for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) within the specified time frame.
5. Therefore, the chosen tool for this task is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-11 23:47:25,525 - INFO - 1. history_score:
The history of the patient is not directly related to the HEART Score parameters listed in the Function Docstring. Since there is no clear indication of the patient's history score in the Reference Text, we will assign a random value based on the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.

Randomly Assigning history_score value: 1

2. ekg_score:
The EKG findings mentioned in the Reference Text include ST segment deviation. According to the Function Docstring, "ST deviation" corresponds to a score of 2. Therefore, we will assign a value of 2 to the ekg_score parameter.

Assigned ekg_score value: 2

3. age_score:
The age of the patient is provided in the Reference Text as 65 years old. Since the patient's age falls into the category of "65 or older," the age_score parameter should be assigned a value of 2.

Assigned age_score value: 2

4. risk_factors_score:
The Reference Text does not provide specific information about the number of cardiovascular risk factors for the patient. Thus, we will assign a random value to the risk_factors_score parameter based on the Function Docstring scoring standards.

Randomly Assigning risk_factors_score value: 1

5. troponin_score:
The Reference Text mentions the initial troponin levels of the patient, but it does not specify the exact levels to determine the score. Since there is no clear indication, we will assign a random value to the troponin_score parameter according to the Function Docstring.

Randomly Assigning troponin_score value: 1

    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
