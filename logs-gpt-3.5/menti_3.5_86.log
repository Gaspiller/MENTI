2025-08-12 00:11:43,449 - INFO - 1. The user is seeking to identify which tool is used to assess the postoperative risk of the patient. 
2. Considering the patient's history of lung cancer with metastasis to the 6th thoracic vertebra and respiratory symptoms like coughing, the tool that would be most suitable for assessing the postoperative risk in this case is the "ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications."
3. The ARISCAT Score specifically evaluates the risk of pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery, which aligns with the patient's respiratory issues and history of lung cancer.
4. By using the parameters of age, respiratory issues, type of incision, and surgery duration, the ARISCAT Score can provide valuable insights into the patient's postoperative pulmonary risk.
5. Therefore, the chosen tool for assessing the postoperative risk in this scenario is the "ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications."

2025-08-12 00:11:47,536 - INFO - 1. Age:
   - In the reference text, it is mentioned that the patient is a 79-year-old male.
   - Therefore, the Age parameter value is 79.

2. Spo2:
   - There is no explicit mention of preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the reference text.
   - We can assume a standard value of 95% for Spo2.
   
3. Respiratory Infection:
   - There is no specific mention of respiratory infection in the reference text.
   - We can assume that since the patient's chief complaints were related to lung issues, there might be a recent respiratory infection.
   - Therefore, we can assume respiratory_infection as 1 (indicating 'Yes').

4. Anemia:
   - There is no direct mention of preoperative anemia in the reference text.
   - Since there is no clear information provided, we can assume that the patient does not have preoperative anemia.
   - Therefore, we can assume anemia as 0 (indicating 'No').

5. Surgical Incision:
   - There is no specific mention of the type of surgical incision in the reference text.
   - There is an indication of lung cancer and thoracic involvement, so we can assume that the surgical incision might be 'Intrathoracic'.
   - Therefore, we can assume surgical_incision as 2 (indicating 'Intrathoracic').

6. Surgery Duration:
   - There is no information regarding the duration of the surgery in the reference text.
   - We can assume a standard duration of 2 hours for the surgery.
   
7. Emergency:
   - There is no mention of whether the procedure was an emergency in the reference text.
   - Since the patient's condition seems to require urgent attention due to lung cancer, we can assume that the procedure might be considered emergency.
   - Therefore, we can assume emergency as 1 (indicating 'Yes').

{{Calculate the ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications.
    This score helps predict the risk of pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery under general, neuraxial, or regional anesthesia.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    spo2 (int): Preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) percentage.
    respiratory_infection (int): Indicates the presence of respiratory infection in the last month. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
    anemia (int): Indicates preoperative anemia (Hgb ≤10 g/dL). 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
    surgical_incision (int): Type of surgical incision. 0 for 'Peripheral', 1 for 'Upper abdominal', 2 for 'Intrathoracic'.
    surgery_duration (int): Duration of the surgery in hours.
    emergency (int): Indicates if the procedure was an emergency. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.

    Returns:
    int: The ARISCAT score, which is a summation of points based on the provided parameters.
