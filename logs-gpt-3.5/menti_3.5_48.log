2025-08-11 23:46:14,925 - INFO - 1. The parameter `elevated_risk_surgery` should be filled based on the presence of specific surgeries like intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular surgeries. Since no such surgeries are mentioned in the reference text, we infer that the surgery is not of elevated risk. Therefore, `elevated_risk_surgery` should be `false`.

2. The parameter `history_of_ischemic_heart_disease` should be filled based on the history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, use of nitrate therapy, or ECG showing pathological Q waves. There is no mention of any of these conditions in the reference text, so we infer that there is no history of ischemic heart disease. Therefore, `history_of_ischemic_heart_disease` should be `false`.

3. The parameter `history_of_congestive_heart_failure` should be filled based on signs like pulmonary edema, bilateral rales, S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution. Since none of these signs are mentioned in the reference text, we infer that there is no history of congestive heart failure. Therefore, `history_of_congestive_heart_failure` should be `false`.

4. The parameter `history_of_cerebrovascular_disease` should be filled based on the history of transient ischemic attack or stroke. There is no mention of such history in the reference text, so we infer that there is no history of cerebrovascular disease. Therefore, `history_of_cerebrovascular_disease` should be `false`.

5. The parameter `preop_treatment_with_insulin` should be filled based on whether the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively. There is no mention of this treatment in the reference text, so we infer that the patient is not being treated with insulin pre-operatively. Therefore, `preop_treatment_with_insulin` should be `false`.

6. The parameter `preop_creatinine_above_threshold` should be filled based on whether pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L. There is no mention of creatinine levels in the reference text, so we infer that the levels are below the threshold. Therefore, `preop_creatinine_above_threshold` should be `false`.

2025-08-11 23:46:55,499 - INFO - 1. Elevated Risk Surgery:
   In the Reference Text, there is no specific mention of the type of surgery the patient underwent. Since there is no clear indication, we cannot determine whether the surgery was intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular. Therefore, we will assume the value randomly.
   
2. History of Ischemic Heart Disease:
   The Reference Text does not provide any information about a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain related to myocardial ischemia, use of nitrate therapy, or ECG showing pathological Q waves. Based on this information, we can infer that the patient does not have a history of ischemic heart disease. Hence, the value for this parameter should be False.
   
3. History of Congestive Heart Failure:
   The Reference Text does not mention any signs of congestive heart failure, such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or findings on chest X-ray. Therefore, we can infer that the patient does not have a history of congestive heart failure. Hence, the value for this parameter should be False.
   
4. History of Cerebrovascular Disease:
   The Reference Text does not indicate any history of transient ischemic attack or stroke. Therefore, we can infer that the patient does not have a history of cerebrovascular disease. Hence, the value for this parameter should be False.
   
5. Preop Treatment with Insulin:
   There is no mention in the Reference Text about the patient receiving insulin treatment pre-operatively. Since there is no information provided, we will assume the value for this parameter randomly.
   
6. Preop Creatinine Above Threshold:
   The Reference Text states that the patient's creatinine levels were normal. Since the pre-operative creatinine levels were not above the specified threshold of greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L, we can conclude that the value for this parameter is False.

2025-08-11 23:47:00,305 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
