2025-08-12 00:12:09,896 - INFO - 1. The user demand is to identify the tool used to assess the pre-operative cardiac risk in patients.
2. Looking at the Tool List, the tool that fits this requirement is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk".
3. The "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery.
4. This tool calculates the total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score based on specific risk factors present in the patient.
5. The risk factors considered in this tool include elevated risk surgery, history of ischemic heart disease, history of congestive heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, preop treatment with insulin, and preop creatinine above threshold.
6. The total score obtained from this tool helps in risk stratification and aids in discussions about informed consent with patients.
7. Therefore, the chosen tool based on the user demand is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk".

2025-08-12 00:12:15,664 - INFO - 1. elevated_risk_surgery: 
   - Reference Text does not provide direct information regarding the type of surgery (intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular). As this parameter is essential for determining the risk index, we cannot infer the value for this parameter based on the given information. 
   - Randomly assign a value: True

2. history_of_ischemic_heart_disease: 
   - There is no explicit mention of a history of ischemic heart disease in the Reference Text. 
   - No specific information to infer this parameter. 
   - Randomly assign a value: False

3. history_of_congestive_heart_failure: 
   - The Reference Text does not provide any information about congestive heart failure history.
   - No clear indication to infer this parameter.
   - Randomly assign a value: False

4. history_of_cerebrovascular_disease: 
   - There is no indication in the Reference Text regarding a history of cerebrovascular disease. 
   - No specific details to infer this parameter.
   - Randomly assign a value: False

5. preop_treatment_with_insulin:
   - The text mentions "未使用胰岛素治疗" which translates to "preoperative insulin treatment was not used" suggesting the absence of preoperative insulin treatment.
   - Based on the provided information, we can infer a value for this parameter.
   - Assign the value: False

6. preop_creatinine_above_threshold: 
   - The Reference Text provides the creatinine level as "肌酐正常" which translates to "creatinine normal". 
   - The standard threshold mentioned in the Function Docstring is "greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L".
   - As the creatinine level is normal, we can infer a value for this parameter.
   - Assign the value: False

2025-08-12 00:12:27,471 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
