You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:

1. The patient is diagnosed with gestational diabetes, which is a type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and can lead to high blood sugar levels. This condition can impair glucose regulation and metabolism in the body, affecting both the mother and the developing fetus.

2. The patient also has fungal vaginitis, which can indicate an imbalance in the vaginal microbiome and may lead to symptoms such as abnormal vaginal discharge and itching. This condition can impair the normal functioning of the vaginal environment.

3. The presence of oligohydramnios, which is a condition characterized by reduced amniotic fluid levels in the uterus, can have implications for fetal development and can affect the normal cushioning and protection provided by the amniotic fluid.

Based on the provided patient's case, the impaired bodily functions may include glucose regulation and metabolism, vaginal flora balance, and amniotic fluid production. These conditions require proper management and treatment to ensure the well-being of both the mother and the fetus.
