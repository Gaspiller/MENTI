[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于计算高血糖患者的实际钠水平？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和检查结果，可以初步推断患者可能患有糖尿病引起的高血糖。在激素冲击治疗后，患者出现口渴、多饮、多尿等症状，血糖检测结果显示明显升高。此外，尿液分析显示尿葡萄糖为强阳性，尿蛋白也为阳性，尿隐血为强阳性，红细胞沉渣高，这些都是糖尿病的常见表现。肾功能检查显示肾功能受损，肌酐升高较为明显，可能与患者之前诊断的IgA肾病有关。因此，患者可能存在糖尿病引起的高血糖和肾功能受损的情况。需要进一步内分泌科专业治疗。
