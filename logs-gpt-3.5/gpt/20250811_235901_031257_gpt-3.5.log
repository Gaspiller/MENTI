You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 孕期预产期计算器可用于推算预产期，基于什么信息？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病历显示，患者出现了胎膜早破的情况，这可以导致羊水漏出，增加孕妇和胎儿的感染风险。此外，胎膜早破也可能引起早产，需要密切监测胎儿情况以及预防感染。

由于胎膜早破引起了阴道流液，可以导致腹部疼痛、感染等并发症。因此，需要密切观察孕妇的症状，并及时采取必要的治疗措施。

除胎膜早破外，病史中还提到脐带绕颈的情况，这可能会影响胎儿的供氧情况，需要监测胎心音及胎动，并及时采取必要的处理措施。

总体而言，患者需要密切监测胎儿情况，防止感染，并在必要时进行紧急处理以确保母婴的安全。
