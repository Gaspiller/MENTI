[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于预测患者在6周内发生重大心脏不良事件的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和体格检查结果，可以初步推断患者可能出现了慢性心力衰竭、扩张型心肌病、心功能Ⅳ级、心律失常、心房颤动等症状。心脏超声显示全心扩大、左室功能减低、主动脉硬化等改变，冠脉造影提示冠状动脉多处狭窄，这些都可能导致心脏功能减弱，造成心功能不全。此外，患者的腹水肿、肺部湿性啰音及肺功能下降，说明可能还存在着慢性阻塞性肺疾病急性发作的情况。电解质异常和BNP升高也暗示着可能发生了电解质紊乱和心力衰竭。综上所述，患者的心脏、肺部功能可能受到影响，导致了心力衰竭和其他并发症的发生。
