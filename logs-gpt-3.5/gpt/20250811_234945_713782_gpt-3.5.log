[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于预测心脏事件的风险，特别是对于先天性心脏病患者？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病例信息，患者被诊断为先天性心脏病，主要表现为房间隔缺损和轻度三尖瓣关闭不全。这导致右心增大，心包腔有少量积液。患者同时出现贫血和脾大的症状。房间隔缺损和三尖瓣关闭不全会导致心脏功能受损，可能导致心功能不全，表现为NYHA分级的心功能Ⅰ级。综合分析病例，患者可能存在心脏功能下降、心衰和贫血等问题。治疗方案中介入封堵术治疗后病情好转，但患者需长期随访和监测心脏功能。
