Tool List: {{['Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'MELD Na (UNOS/OPTN)', 'Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)', 'Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity', 'Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

    Parameters:
        age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.
        ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.
        platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).
        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.


CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk: Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表用于评估患者的肝纤维化程度？}}
Task Scenario: {{Analysis:

The patient's case indicates acute hepatitis B with jaundice and concomitant EB virus infection. This is supported by clinical symptoms such as fever, yellowing of the skin and eyes, as well as vomiting after consuming fatty foods. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT), abnormal coagulation parameters, and high levels of bilirubin, indicating liver damage. Additionally, the presence of HBsAg and EB virus nucleic acid in the blood further confirms the diagnosis.

Impaired bodily functions:
1. Liver function: The significant elevation of liver enzymes and bilirubin levels suggest impaired liver function, likely due to viral hepatitis and liver inflammation.
2. Coagulation: Abnormal coagulation tests indicate impaired blood clotting function, which can be a manifestation of liver dysfunction in acute hepatitis.
3. Digestive system: Vomiting after consuming fatty foods may indicate gastrointestinal involvement, possibly due to liver dysfunction affecting bile secretion and digestion.

Overall, the main impaired bodily functions in this case are liver function, coagulation, and potentially, the digestive system. Treatment with antiviral medication, liver protection, and supportive care has led to improvement in the patient's condition.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. The user demand is to identify a tool used to evaluate the degree of liver fibrosis in patients.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with acute hepatitis B and concomitant EB virus infection, leading to liver dysfunction and impaired bodily functions including liver function, coagulation, and potentially the digestive system.

3. Based on the provided information, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis." This tool calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful in patients with risk factors for liver diseases like chronic hepatitis, which aligns with the patient's acute hepatitis B condition.
