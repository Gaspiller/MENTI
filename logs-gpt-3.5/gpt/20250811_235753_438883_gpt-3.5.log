You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估患者抑郁症的严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

Based on the provided patient's case, the main abnormality observed is severe depression that initially manifested as emotional distress, lack of interest, social withdrawal, insomnia, decreased appetite, and frequent crying spells. The patient's clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe depression is supported by symptoms such as low mood, irritability, difficulty in concentrating, and feelings of hopelessness.

The impaired bodily functions in this case are likely related to mental health issues, specifically affecting the patient's emotional well-being, cognitive functions, and sleep patterns. The patient's symptoms of insomnia, decreased appetite, and emotional instability indicate potential disruptions in neurotransmitter functions and mood regulation.

The treatment with antidepressant medications like Quetiapine and Sertraline, along with psychosocial support, points towards addressing the chemical imbalances in the brain and restoring emotional stability. The patient's response to the treatment, with stable condition, suggests that the medication is effectively targeting the underlying neurological mechanisms contributing to depression.
