You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

Patient Case Analysis:

Based on the provided patient's case, the main abnormal parts include:
1. Productive cough with yellow sputum for 4 days, along with fever and lung inflammation observed in the chest CT scan.
2. History of hypertension and diabetes for over 12 and 14 years, respectively, with current elevated blood pressure of 168/85mmHg.
3. Presence of slight tachypnea and coarse breath sounds in both lungs, with occasional wheezing and moist rales in the right lung.
4. Mild bilateral pedal edema present.

Speculated impaired bodily functions may include:
1. Respiratory function due to the presence of cough, sputum production, and lung inflammation, indicating a respiratory infection or exacerbation of a pre-existing lung condition like bronchitis.
2. Cardiovascular function could be affected due to the high blood pressure and the presence of bilateral pedal edema, suggesting possible heart failure or fluid retention issues.
3. Renal function might be impaired to some extent as indicated by the slightly elevated BUN levels.

Further evaluation and treatment targeting these areas are recommended based on the patient's symptoms and medical history.
