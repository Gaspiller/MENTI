Detailed information of each tool: {{STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Calculate the STOP-BANG Score for screening Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

    This score is useful for patients undergoing preoperative evaluation but should not be used if a patient
    has already been diagnosed with OSA or uses CPAP at night. It helps in identifying patients who might have
    OSA and are at increased risk of perioperative cardiopulmonary complications, as well as other morbidity
    associated with OSA like daytime sleepiness and cardiopulmonary conditions.

    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
    2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

    This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
    including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
    It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
    to assess and monitor treatment responses.

    Parameters:
    - nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
    - control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.

Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation): 
    Calculate the Creatinine Clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation.

    This function estimates kidney function, useful for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) staging
    and adjusting or discontinuing medications based on kidney function. It incorporates
    the patient's age, weight, sex, and serum creatinine levels to calculate the clearance rate.
    This is particularly relevant when considering medication dosages for patients with reduced
    kidney function, despite potential overestimations in GFR with newer creatinine assays.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Should be a positive integer.
    - weight (float): The weight of the patient in kilograms. Should be a positive decimal.
    - creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level in mg/dL. Should be a positive decimal.
    - sex (str): The sex of the patient. Acceptable values are 'male' or 'female'.
                 This affects the calculation as there is a different multiplier for females.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated creatinine clearance in mL/min.
    
    Example:
    >>> calculate_creatinine_clearance(50, 70, 1.2, 'female')
    49.30555555555556
  

Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS): Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.

NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS): 
    Calculate the NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS).

    The NIHSS helps physicians quantify the severity of a stroke in the acute setting. 
    Increasing scores indicate a more severe stroke and correlate with the size of the infarction on both CT and MRI evaluation.
    Scores assessed within the first 48 hours following a stroke have been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes at the 3-month and 1-year mark.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia: Calculate the corrected calcium level in patients with suspected hypocalcemia
    who have low albumin levels. Hypocalcemia might not be apparent if serum albumin is low,
    thus this formula adjusts the calcium level based on albumin discrepancy.

    Args:
    normal_albumin (float): The normal albumin level in g/dL assumed for the calculation.
    patient_albumin (float): The patient's measured albumin level in g/dL.

Corrected QT Interval (QTc): Calculate the Corrected QT Interval (QTc) for a patient.

    The QTc is used primarily to assess the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, especially torsades de pointes, 
    in patients with syncope or those receiving multiple QT-prolonging medications. A prolonged QT interval 
    can indicate a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This function corrects the QT interval to a heart rate 
    of 60 beats per minute, accounting for variations due to different heart rates.

    Parameters:
        qt_interval (float): The measured QT interval in milliseconds.
        heart_rate (float): The patient's heart rate in beats per minute.
        formula (str): The formula to use for correction. Options are 'Bazett', 'Fridericia', 
                       'Framingham', 'Hodges', and 'Rautaharju'.

    Returns:
        float: The corrected QT interval (QTc) in milliseconds.

    Example:
