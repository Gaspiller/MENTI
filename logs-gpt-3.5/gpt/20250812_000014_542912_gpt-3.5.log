[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者社区获得性肺炎的严重程度指数？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和辅助检查结果显示患者患有支气管肺炎，表现为咳嗽、咳痰、发热等症状。血常规显示白细胞计数偏高，中性粒细胞比例较高，提示可能存在细菌感染。患者PH值、血氧分压和其他生化指标显示机体代谢调节功能较为正常，但白细胞计数和中性粒细胞比例的异常值可能对机体免疫功能和炎症反应有一定影响。

由于支气管肺炎是呼吸系统感染引起的疾病，主要影响呼吸功能，可能导致呼吸困难、肺部感染等问题。在治疗过程中，应重点观察病情变化，及时调整治疗方案。
