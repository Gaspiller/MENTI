You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis', 'Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk', 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)', 'PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism', 'Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events:  Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表用于评估手术前患者的心脏风险？}}
Task Scenario: {{Analyzing the provided patient's case, the main abnormal parts include self-ingestion of a large amount of rodenticide, self-inflicted stab wounds to the chest and abdomen resulting in liver contusion, abdominal fluid accumulation, and hemorrhagic anemia. These factors indicate impairment in the liver function due to the potential liver tear injury, as evidenced by the presence of liver contusion and fluid accumulation around the liver. Additionally, the hemorrhagic anemia suggests impaired blood clotting and reduced red blood cell count. The treatment with blood purification injections also supports the diagnosis of liver injury and associated complications.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. The user demand is to identify which tool is used to assess pre-operative cardiac risk in patients.
2. Based on the task scenario provided, it is evident that the patient has significant liver injury and associated complications due to self-ingestion of rodenticide, stab wounds to the chest and abdomen resulting in liver contusion, abdominal fluid accumulation, and hemorrhagic anemia.
3. Given the liver-related complications and the need to assess pre-operative cardiac risk, the most suitable tool from the tool list would be the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
4. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is specifically designed to evaluate the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent non-cardiac surgery, taking into account specific risk factors such as a history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, pre-operative insulin treatment, and elevated pre-operative creatinine levels.
5. By using the Revised Cardiac Risk Index in this patient's case, healthcare providers can better assess the patient's cardiac risk and make informed decisions regarding pre-operative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
6. Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List based on the User Demand and Task Scenario is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
