You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications.
    This score helps predict the risk of pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery under general, neuraxial, or regional anesthesia.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    spo2 (int): Preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) percentage.
    respiratory_infection (int): Indicates the presence of respiratory infection in the last month. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
    anemia (int): Indicates preoperative anemia (Hgb ≤10 g/dL). 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
    surgical_incision (int): Type of surgical incision. 0 for 'Peripheral', 1 for 'Upper abdominal', 2 for 'Intrathoracic'.
    surgery_duration (int): Duration of the surgery in hours.
    emergency (int): Indicates if the procedure was an emergency. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.

    Returns:
    int: The ARISCAT score, which is a summation of points based on the provided parameters.

[病案介绍]
主诉:
男性,60岁,农民
咳嗽、咳痰5天入院。
现病史:
于入院前5天,因受凉后出现咳嗽、咳痰,痰为白色痰,不易咳出,无恶心、呕吐,无抽搐,无意识不清及大小便失禁等,体温波动于37℃左右,在家未特殊诊治而来我院,今日为进一步治疗来我院查肺CT示:右肺下叶炎性改变、右侧胸膜肥厚并胸腔及叶间积液,遂以“肺部感染”收入院。患者自发病以来,食欲差精神、睡眠尚可,二便正常,体重无变化。
既往史:
既往慢性胃炎病史10余年,未正规治疗,否认高血压病史,否认糖尿病病史,否认冠心病病史无肝炎、结核等传染病病史,无外伤、手术及输血史,无药物过敏史。预防接种史不详,系统回顾无特殊。
查体:
T：37.0℃，P：106次/分，R：18次/分，BP：130/80mmHg
全身皮肤粘膜无黄染及出血点,周身浅表淋巴结未触及肿大。口唇无发绀,咽无充血,颈软,甲状腺不大。两肺听诊呼吸音粗糙,可闻及湿性啰音。心界无扩大,心律106次/分,节律规整,心音低钝,各瓣膜听诊区未闻及病理性杂音。腹部平坦,腹部无压痛、反跳痛,触无包块,肝脾肋下未触及,腹叩鼓音,移动性浊音阴性,听诊肠鸣音正常存在。双肾区无叩痛,双下肢无指凹性水肿。四肢肌力肌张力正常,生理反射正常存在,病理反射未引出。
辅助检查:
肺CT示:右肺下叶炎性改变、右侧胸膜肥厚并胸腔及叶间积液患者BUN：13mg/dL。

For the Mean Corpuscular Hemoglobin Concentration (MCHC), 平均红细胞血红蛋白浓度, 0.0 mg/L is equal to 0.0 mg%}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Age:
   - In the reference text, the patient's age is given as 60 years, so the Age parameter value is 60.

2. Spo2:
   - The reference text does not explicitly mention the preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) percentage. Since the patient is admitted for pulmonary infection, we can assume the Spo2 might not be at an optimal level. Let's assume a Spo2 value of 90%.

3. Respiratory Infection:
   - The reference text mentions that the patient is admitted for a lung infection, indicating the presence of a respiratory infection. Therefore, the Respiratory Infection parameter value is 1.

4. Anemia:
   - There is no specific information provided regarding preoperative anemia in the reference text. Since anemia is a common complication in lung infections, let's assume that the patient might have anemia. Therefore, the Anemia parameter value is 1.

5. Surgical Incision:
   - The reference text does not mention the type of surgical incision. Since the patient is admitted for a lung infection, which might require surgery, let's assume the surgery involved an Intrathoracic incision. Therefore, the Surgical Incision parameter value is 2.

6. Surgery Duration:
   - The reference text does not provide information on the duration of the surgery. Let's assume a standard surgery duration of 2 hours. Therefore, the Surgery Duration parameter value is 2.

7. Emergency:
   - There is no clear mention of whether the procedure was an emergency in the reference text. Since the patient is admitted for a lung infection, which might be urgent, let's assume it was an emergency procedure. Therefore, the Emergency parameter value is 1.
