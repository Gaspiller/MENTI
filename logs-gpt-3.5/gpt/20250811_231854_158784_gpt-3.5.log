You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}
Step By Step Analysis:
{{Here is your step-by-step analysis.}}
Parameters List:
```json
{
    "weight": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "kg"},
    "height": {"Value": 175, "Unit": "cm"}
}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.
    
    The HAS-BLED Score is used to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding and helps guide decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy.
    This scoring system can be considered alongside other bleeding risk scores or thromboembolic risk assessments to weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation.

    Parameters:
    hypertension (bool): True if the patient has hypertension, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has renal disease (dialysis, transplant, or Cr >2.26 mg/dL), False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has liver disease (cirrhosis or bilirubin >2x normal with AST/ALT/AP >3x normal), False otherwise.
    stroke_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, False otherwise.
    major_bleeding_history (bool): True if the patient has had prior major bleeding or predisposition to bleeding, False otherwise.
    labile_inr (bool): True if the patient has labile INR (unstable/high INRs, time in therapeutic range <60%), False otherwise.
    elderly (bool): True if the patient is elderly (age >65), False otherwise.
    medication_risk (bool): True if the patient uses medication that predisposes to bleeding (aspirin, clopidogrel, NSAIDs), False otherwise.
    alcohol_usage (bool): True if the patient consumes alcohol significantly (â‰¥8 drinks/week), False otherwise.

    Returns:
    int: The total HAS-BLED score, which is a sum of all applicable risk factors.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_has_bled_score(True, False, False, True, False, True, True, False, True)

Reference Text:
{{The 'history_of_hypertension' parameter is missing a boolean value, which needs to be provided.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Extracting the parameter 'hypertension':
    - The 'hypertension' parameter indicates whether the patient has hypertension.
    - From the Reference Text, it is stated that the 'history_of_hypertension' parameter is missing a boolean value.
    - Since 'history_of_hypertension' corresponds to 'hypertension' in the Function Docstring, we can infer that the patient has a history of hypertension.
    - Therefore, the value for 'hypertension' is True.

2. Extracting the parameter 'renal_disease':
    - The 'renal_disease' parameter indicates whether the patient has renal disease.
    - There is no specific information provided in the Reference Text regarding renal disease.
    - As there is no mention of renal disease, we will randomly assign a value to this parameter.
    
3. Extracting the parameter 'liver_disease':
    - The 'liver_disease' parameter indicates whether the patient has liver disease.
    - There is no specific information provided in the Reference Text regarding liver disease.
    - As there is no mention of liver disease, we will randomly assign a value to this parameter.
    
4. Extracting the parameter 'stroke_history':
    - The 'stroke_history' parameter indicates whether the patient has a history of stroke.
    - From the Reference Text, there is no mention of a history of stroke.
    - Therefore, we will randomly assign a value to this parameter.

5. Extracting the parameter 'major_bleeding_history':
    - The 'major_bleeding_history' parameter indicates whether the patient has had prior major bleeding or predisposition to bleeding.
    - There is no information provided in the Reference Text regarding prior major bleeding or predisposition to bleeding.
    - As there is no mention of major bleeding history, we will randomly assign a value to this parameter.

6. Extracting the parameter 'labile_inr':
    - The 'labile_inr' parameter indicates whether the patient has labile INR.
    - There is no specific information provided in the Reference Text regarding labile INR.
    - As there is no mention of labile INR, we will randomly assign a value to this parameter.
    
7. Extracting the parameter 'elderly':
    - The 'elderly' parameter indicates whether the patient is elderly (age >65).
    - There is no specific information provided in the Reference Text regarding the patient's age.
    - As there is no mention of the patient's age, we will randomly assign a value to this parameter.

8. Extracting the parameter 'medication_risk':
    - The 'medication_risk' parameter indicates whether the patient uses medication that predisposes to bleeding.
    - There is no specific information provided in the Reference Text regarding medication that predisposes to bleeding.
    - As there is no mention of medication risk, we will randomly assign a value to this parameter.

9. Extracting the parameter 'alcohol_usage':
    - The 'alcohol_usage' parameter indicates whether the patient consumes alcohol significantly.
    - There is no specific information provided in the Reference Text regarding alcohol usage.
    - As there is no mention of alcohol usage, we will randomly assign a value to this parameter.
