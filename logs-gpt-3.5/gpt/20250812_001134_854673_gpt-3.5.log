You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:
Based on the patient's complaint of coughing, back pain for 10 months that worsened, and a history of lung cancer with metastasis to the 6th thoracic vertebra, it is evident that the patient's respiratory and musculoskeletal systems are significantly affected. The presence of lung cancer can impair proper lung function, leading to symptoms such as coughing, shortness of breath, and chest discomfort. The metastasis to the 6th thoracic vertebra may be causing the back pain reported by the patient. Further evaluation and treatment of the lung cancer and vertebral metastasis are necessary to address the abnormalities in the patient's case.
