You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}
Step By Step Analysis:
{{Here is your step-by-step analysis.}}
Parameters List:
```json
{
    "weight": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "kg"},
    "height": {"Value": 175, "Unit": "cm"}
}
```

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.
    
    Parameters:
    - hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
    - bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

    Returns:
    - int: Glasgow-Blatchford Score, ranging from 0 to 23.

    This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Extract the parameters based on the Function Docstring:
- hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
- bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
- systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
- sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
- heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
- melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
- syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
- hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
- cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

2. Analyze the Reference Text for parameter values:
- hemoglobin: Not explicitly mentioned in the text.
- bun: Not explicitly mentioned in the text.
- systolic_bp: 135 mmHg
- sex: Male (1)
- heart_rate: Not mentioned, need to infer based on the patient's condition.
- melena: Not mentioned, need to infer based on the patient's condition.
- syncope: Not mentioned, need to infer based on the patient's condition.
- hepatic_disease: Not mentioned, need to infer based on the patient's condition.
- cardiac_failure: Not mentioned, need to infer based on the patient's condition.

3. Inference based on the patient's condition:
- hemoglobin: Unable to determine from the text.
- bun: Unable to determine from the text.
- heart_rate: The heart rate is not explicitly provided, so we may infer a value based on the patient's condition, which is likely abnormal due to drug overdose. Let's assume heart_rate = 1 (≥100 per minute).
- melena: Melena is not specifically mentioned, but considering the patient ingested a large amount of sleeping pills, melena (black, tarry stools) might be present. Let's assume melena = 1.
- syncope: The presence of recent syncope is not mentioned in the text. We may assume syncope = 0 since it's not reported.
- hepatic_disease: The history of hepatic disease is not mentioned in the text. We may assume hepatic_disease = 0 since it is not indicated.
- cardiac_failure: The presence of cardiac failure is not mentioned in the text. We may assume cardiac_failure = 0 since it is not reported.

4. Compile the parameters list:
```json
{
    "hemoglobin": {"Value": "null", "Unit": "g/dL"},
    "bun": {"Value": "null", "Unit": "mg/dL"},
    "systolic_bp": {"Value": 135, "Unit": "mm Hg"},
    "sex": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"},
    "heart_rate": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"},
    "melena": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"},
    "syncope": {"Value": 0, "Unit": "null"},
    "hepatic_disease": {"Value": 0, "Unit": "null"},
    "cardiac_failure": {"Value": 0, "Unit": "null"}
}
```
