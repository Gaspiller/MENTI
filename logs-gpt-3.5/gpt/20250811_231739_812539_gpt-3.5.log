[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者心房纤颤患者的卒中风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和查体结果，可以推断患者的主要异常为二尖瓣狭窄。根据胸部X光片和心电图结果显示左心房增大，双侧膈顶光滑，心电图显示“P”波消失，代之以“f”波，这些都表明可能存在心脏结构异常。二尖瓣狭窄会导致心脏功能受损，血液流动受阻，从而引起心悸、气促等症状。因此，患者可能存在心功能不全的问题，并且需要进一步的心脏检查和治疗。
