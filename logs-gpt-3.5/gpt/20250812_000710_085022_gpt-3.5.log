[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估该患者社区获得性肺炎的严重程度指数？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病史和辅助检查结果，患者主要表现为咳嗽、咳痰，伴有发热，胸部CT显示左下肺可见斑片状及条索状高密度影，血液分析白细胞增高，中性粒细胞比例升高，CRP升高等，这些都提示患者可能患有肺部感染。可能导致呼吸道受累，影响呼吸功能，出现气促等症状。建议进一步关注肺部感染的治疗和恢复。
