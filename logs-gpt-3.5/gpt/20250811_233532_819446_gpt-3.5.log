[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估该患者未来10年内发生冠心病风险的情况？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和检查结果，可以初步推断患者可能存在脑膜瘤和多发小缺血变性灶所导致的发作性意识障碍。此外，患者的双侧额叶、放射冠、侧脑室旁多发小缺血变性灶也可能影响了部分脑功能。另外，患者的双耳感音神经性听力下降可能会影响听觉功能。进一步的神经系统检查和治疗可能有助于确认诊断和提高患者的生活质量。
