You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的肝纤维化程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:

The patient's case indicates acute hepatitis B with jaundice and concomitant EB virus infection. This is supported by clinical symptoms such as fever, yellowing of the skin and eyes, as well as vomiting after consuming fatty foods. Laboratory results show elevated liver enzymes (AST, ALT, GGT), abnormal coagulation parameters, and high levels of bilirubin, indicating liver damage. Additionally, the presence of HBsAg and EB virus nucleic acid in the blood further confirms the diagnosis.

Impaired bodily functions:
1. Liver function: The significant elevation of liver enzymes and bilirubin levels suggest impaired liver function, likely due to viral hepatitis and liver inflammation.
2. Coagulation: Abnormal coagulation tests indicate impaired blood clotting function, which can be a manifestation of liver dysfunction in acute hepatitis.
3. Digestive system: Vomiting after consuming fatty foods may indicate gastrointestinal involvement, possibly due to liver dysfunction affecting bile secretion and digestion.

Overall, the main impaired bodily functions in this case are liver function, coagulation, and potentially, the digestive system. Treatment with antiviral medication, liver protection, and supportive care has led to improvement in the patient's condition.
