    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has renal disease (dialysis, transplant, or Cr >2.26 mg/dL), False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has liver disease (cirrhosis or bilirubin >2x normal with AST/ALT/AP >3x normal), False otherwise.
    stroke_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, False otherwise.

This calculation is essential in identifying the type of acidosis a patient might have, differentiating between gap and non-gap acidoses. Elevated Anion Gap suggests the presence of additional unmeasured anions in the blood, which could indicate conditions like ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or poisoning by substances such as methanol.
