You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'Corrected QT Interval (QTc)', 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications', 'Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk', 'Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events:  Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

    The QTc is used primarily to assess the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, especially torsades de pointes, 
    in patients with syncope or those receiving multiple QT-prolonging medications. A prolonged QT interval 
    can indicate a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This function corrects the QT interval to a heart rate 
    of 60 beats per minute, accounting for variations due to different heart rates.

    Parameters:
        qt_interval (float): The measured QT interval in milliseconds.
        heart_rate (float): The patient's heart rate in beats per minute.
        formula (str): The formula to use for correction. Options are 'Bazett', 'Fridericia', 
                       'Framingham', 'Hodges', and 'Rautaharju'.

    Returns:
        float: The corrected QT interval (QTc) in milliseconds.

    Example:
        >>> calculate_qtc(300, 70, 'Bazett')
        357.0

    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.

    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.
    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表被用于预测患者在接受冠状动脉造影术+左心导管术后6周内发生重大心脏不良事件的风险？}}
Task Scenario: {{Analysis:
1. The patient has a history of X syndrome, acute bronchitis, peptic ulcer, post-traumatic brain sequelae, and chronic otitis media. These conditions suggest a complex medical history with possible underlying systemic issues.
2. The patient presented with symptoms of chest tightness, shortness of breath, and headache, which led to a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. This indicates a potential cardiovascular issue, possibly related to coronary artery disease or myocardial ischemia.
3. The patient's past medical history includes hypertension, traumatic brain injury, and nerve damage in the left arm, indicating a history of vascular and neurological issues.
4. The patient underwent coronary angiography and left heart catheterization, which resulted in disease improvement. This suggests that the cardiovascular system was affected and required intervention to address the issue.

Speculated Impairments:
1. Impaired cardiovascular function, possibly due to coronary artery disease or myocardial ischemia.
2. Possible neurological impairments related to the past traumatic brain injury and nerve damage in the left arm.
3. Long-standing otitis media may have impacted the patient's auditory function.

It is crucial for the medical team to closely monitor the patient's cardiovascular and neurological status, as well as provide appropriate follow-up care for the otitis media to ensure overall well-being.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. The user demand requires a tool that is used to predict the risk of a patient experiencing major cardiac events within 6 weeks after undergoing coronary angiography and left heart catheterization.

2. Based on the user demand and task scenario analysis:
    - The patient has a complex medical history with systemic issues.
    - Presenting symptoms indicate acute coronary syndrome.
    - Past medical history includes hypertension and vascular and neurological issues.
    - Underwent coronary angiography and left heart catheterization for improvement.

3. Considering the patient's cardiovascular issues and the need to predict the risk of major cardiac events post-procedure, the most suitable tool from the tool list is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

4. The HEART Score assesses the risk of major cardiac events in patients with chest pain and can help risk-stratify individuals into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome.
