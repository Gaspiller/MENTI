Detailed information of each tool: {{CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk: Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
    - history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(75, 'female', True, True, True, True, True)
    9

Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score: "Calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score which is used to assess the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.
The score is used to track a patient's status during their stay in an intensive care unit to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.

Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA): Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA) using provided weight and height.

    BMI is a measure of body fat based on weight and height that applies to adult men and women.
    It can be misleading for very muscular individuals or in specific ethnic groups with different
    body compositions and statures.

    BSA is often used in medical settings to determine the dosages of medications that are more 
    accurately calculated using body surface area rather than weight.

    Parameters:
    - weight_kg (float): Weight of the individual in kilograms.
    - height_cm (float): Height of the individual in centimeters.

    Returns:
    - dict: Dictionary containing 'BMI' and 'BSA' with their respective values.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:

Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.
    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.
 

Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS): Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.
    
    Parameters:
    - hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.

    This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.


Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005): Calculate the Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) in surgical patients. The score assesses the risk of VTE
    based on a variety of risk factors and stratifies patients for potential prophylactic interventions. Not applicable

Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia: Calculate the corrected calcium level in patients with suspected hypocalcemia

    8.84
 

Ideal Body Weight and Adjusted Body Weight: Calculate the Ideal Body Weight (IBW) and Adjusted Body Weight (ABW) based on height and gender.
    
    The IBW calculation uses the Devine formula, which is applicable for individuals who are at least 60 inches tall.
    For individuals shorter than 5 feet, the IBW is adjusted by subtracting 2-5 lbs for each inch below 60 inches.
    The ABW is used for obese patients where the actual body weight exceeds the IBW, calculated as:
    ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (actual body weight - IBW).
    
    Parameters:
        height_in_inches (int): The height of the individual in inches.
        actual_body_weight (float): The actual body weight of the individual in kilograms.
        gender (str): The gender of the individual ("male" or "female").

    Returns:
        list: A list containing the IBW and ABW in kilograms. If the individual is not obese, ABW is set equal to IBW.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表用于评估乙肝肝硬化失代偿期患者肝硬化的严重程度？}}
Task Scenario: {{Analysis:
1. The patient presents with symptoms of jaundice, abdominal distension, oliguria, fatigue, poor appetite, and lower limb edema. These symptoms are indicative of liver dysfunction.
2. Clinical diagnoses of severe hepatitis, chronic hepatitis B, decompensated cirrhosis due to hepatitis B suggest impaired liver function and progression of liver disease.
3. Laboratory findings show elevated levels of serum bilirubin, AST, ALT, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated white blood cell count, indicating liver damage and inflammation.
4. Imaging studies reveal hepatomegaly, thickened gallbladder wall, splenomegaly, bilateral renal stones, and ascites, further supporting the diagnosis of liver disease and its complications.
5. The absence of hepatic encephalopathy suggests that the patient's liver function is still able to adequately detoxify ammonia.
6. The patient's INR of 2.4 indicates impaired blood clotting function, likely due to liver dysfunction leading to decreased synthesis of clotting factors.

Speculation:
Based on the evidence provided, the patient is likely experiencing significant liver dysfunction, indicated by jaundice, hepatomegaly, elevated liver enzymes, coagulopathy, and ascites. The presence of multiple complications such as renal stones and splenomegaly may suggest advanced liver disease with portal hypertension. The treatment with antibiotics and supportive therapy aims to manage the underlying liver disease and prevent further complications. Continued monitoring and intervention are essential to prevent disease progression.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. The user demand is to assess the severity of liver cirrhosis in patients with decompensated liver disease due to hepatitis B.
2. The tool that can be used for this scenario is the Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Severity Assessment.
3. The Child-Pugh Score evaluates the severity of liver cirrhosis based on laboratory findings and clinical symptoms, assigning points for parameters such as bilirubin levels, albumin levels, prothrombin time, ascites, and hepatic encephalopathy.
4. By calculating the Child-Pugh Score, healthcare providers can classify patients into different stages of liver cirrhosis (Class A, B, or C) and determine the prognosis and appropriate management strategies.
5. The Child-Pugh Score is a widely used tool in clinical practice for assessing the severity and prognosis of liver cirrhosis in patients with chronic liver disease.
6. Therefore, the chosen tool for this scenario is the Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Severity Assessment.
