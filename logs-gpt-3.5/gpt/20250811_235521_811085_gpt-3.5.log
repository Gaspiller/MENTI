[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的平均动脉压？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病例分析，该患者患有扩心病、慢性心功能不全、心功能III级，且曾进行CRTD植入术后。主要表现为胸闷气短加重，NT-Pro BNP水平升高，心脏超声显示左心主导、肺动脉高压、左室收缩功能减低等。ECG显示完全性左束支传导阻滞。综合分析可以推断该患者出现心衰合并左束支，可能导致心脏传导功能受损，心功能下降，并影响心脏正常收缩和排血，需要密切监测和治疗以改善患者症状和预后。
