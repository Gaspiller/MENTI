[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于计算高血糖患者的实际钠水平？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病历显示，患者出现呕吐、腹泻、意识不清的症状，辅助检查显示随机血糖偏低，可能提示患者出现低血糖症状。此外，患者出现头晕、视物模糊、自述全身无力，可能与低血糖引起的脑部功能受损有关。电解质检查显示氯、钾、钠均有异常，可能进一步影响神经系统功能。综合分析，患者可能存在神经系统功能障碍，包括脑功能受损和神经肌肉功能异常。
