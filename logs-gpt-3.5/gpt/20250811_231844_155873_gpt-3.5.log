You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['Maintenance Fluids Calculations', 'Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk', 'Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia', 'CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity', 'Free Water Deficit in Hypernatremia', 'APACHE II Score', 'Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)', 'Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator', 'Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{Maintenance Fluids Calculations: Calculate the Maintenance Fluids rate using the "4-2-1" Rule.
    
    This function determines the intravenous (IV) fluid rate for patients who are not taking oral fluids,
    addressing needs such as vomiting, NPO status, dehydration, insensible losses, or third spacing. It uses
    a weight-based dosing method to ensure appropriate fluid volume according to patient's weight.
    
    Parameters:
    - weight (float): The weight of the patient in kilograms.
    
    Returns:
    - float: The calculated IV fluid rate in mL per hour.
    
    Usage:
    - This calculation is crucial in medical settings where accurate fluid replacement is necessary,
      particularly in settings where patients cannot intake fluids orally.
    
    Example:
    - calculate_maintenance_fluids(25)  # Calculates fluid rate for a 25 kg patient.

Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity: Calculate the Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity using the Smithline-Gardner Formula.

    This function calculates the serum osmolality/osmolarity based on the concentrations of sodium, glucose,
    and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the blood. Serum osmolality is a measure of the solute concentration in the blood,
    and it can be used to assess the body's fluid and electrolyte balance. An osmolar gap (difference between measured
    and expected osmolality) greater than 10 can indicate the presence of certain toxic alcohols, mannitol, or propylene glycol.

    Note: At extreme levels of serum glucose, such as in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), the osmolar gap may be skewed,
    and clinical judgment should be used.

    Parameters:
    serum_na (float): Serum sodium concentration in mmol/L. Typical reference range is 135-145 mmol/L.
    serum_glucose (float): Serum glucose concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 70-100 mg/dL.
    serum_bun (float): Blood urea nitrogen concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 7-20 mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: Calculated serum osmolality in mOsm/kg.

    Formula:
    Serum Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 2 * (serum_na) + (serum_glucose / 18) + (serum_bun / 2.8)


HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk: Calculate the HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.
    
    The HAS-BLED Score is used to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding and helps guide decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy.
    This scoring system can be considered alongside other bleeding risk scores or thromboembolic risk assessments to weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation.

    Parameters:
    hypertension (bool): True if the patient has hypertension, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has renal disease (dialysis, transplant, or Cr >2.26 mg/dL), False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has liver disease (cirrhosis or bilirubin >2x normal with AST/ALT/AP >3x normal), False otherwise.
    stroke_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, False otherwise.
    major_bleeding_history (bool): True if the patient has had prior major bleeding or predisposition to bleeding, False otherwise.
    labile_inr (bool): True if the patient has labile INR (unstable/high INRs, time in therapeutic range <60%), False otherwise.
    elderly (bool): True if the patient is elderly (age >65), False otherwise.
    medication_risk (bool): True if the patient uses medication that predisposes to bleeding (aspirin, clopidogrel, NSAIDs), False otherwise.
    alcohol_usage (bool): True if the patient consumes alcohol significantly (≥8 drinks/week), False otherwise.

    Returns:
    int: The total HAS-BLED score, which is a sum of all applicable risk factors.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_has_bled_score(True, False, False, True, False, True, True, False, True)
    5

Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia: Calculate the Corrected Sodium for Hyperglycemia using Hillier's method from 1999.

    This function computes the corrected sodium level in patients with hyperglycemia,
    accounting for osmotic shifts of water from the intracellular to the extracellular space,
    which can lead to dilutional hyponatremia. The formula uses a correction factor of 2.4 mEq/L
    for every 100 mg/dL increase in serum glucose above the normal threshold of 100 mg/dL.

    Parameters:
        measured_sodium (float): The measured sodium level in mEq/L.
        serum_glucose (float): The serum glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
        float: The corrected sodium level in mEq/L.

    Example:
        >>> sodium_correction_hyperglycemia(140, 200)
        142.4

CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity: 
    Calculate the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.

    The CURB-65 calculator can be used in the emergency department setting to risk stratify a patient’s community acquired pneumonia.

    Parameters:
    confusion (int): Confusion status, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes.
    bun (int): Blood urea nitrogen status, where 0 = BUN ≤ 19 mg/dL (≤ 7 mmol/L urea) and 1 = BUN > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L urea).

    Returns:
    int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

    Usage:
    This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.
    
    Example:
    >>> curb_65_score(1, 1, 1, 0, 1)
    4
   

Free Water Deficit in Hypernatremia: Calculate the Free Water Deficit (FWD) in a patient with hypernatremia.

    The FWD is a measure used in the management of hypernatremia to determine the amount

    This function uses a standard method recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),
    which considers the first trimester ultrasound measurements to be the most accurate method to establish gestational age.

    Parameters:
    - cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.

    Returns:
    - str: The estimated due date in the format 'Day, Month DD, YYYY'.

    Usage:
    The function is intended for use by healthcare providers to estimate due dates for pregnant patients,
    which can help in managing pregnancy timelines effectively and in planning medical care accordingly.

    Example:
    'Monday, Oct 16, 2023'


Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation): 
    Calculate the Creatinine Clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation.

    This function estimates kidney function, useful for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) staging
    and adjusting or discontinuing medications based on kidney function. It incorporates
    the patient's age, weight, sex, and serum creatinine levels to calculate the clearance rate.
    This is particularly relevant when considering medication dosages for patients with reduced
    kidney function, despite potential overestimations in GFR with newer creatinine assays.
