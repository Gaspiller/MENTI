You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于预测患者在6周内发生重大心脏不良事件的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

The patient's case presents with a history of angina symptoms, including episodic chest pain that worsens at night and is relieved by nitroglycerin. The clinical diagnosis of coronary artery atherosclerotic heart disease indicates impaired blood flow to the heart due to plaque buildup in the coronary arteries. This condition can lead to chest pain and potentially heart attacks.

Additionally, the presence of high blood pressure (hypertension), high cholesterol levels (hyperlipidemia), and narrowing of brain arteries suggest systemic vascular issues. The MRA findings of narrowing in the left posterior cerebral artery and left anterior cerebral artery indicate cerebral artery stenosis, which can impair blood flow to the brain and increase the risk of stroke.

The treatment plan with antiplatelet and anticoagulant medications, as well as interventions to stabilize plaques, dilate coronary arteries, improve circulation, and cardiac remodeling, aims to address the underlying vascular issues and reduce the risk of adverse cardiovascular events.

Overall, the patient's case highlights the importance of managing cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, high cholesterol, and atherosclerosis, to prevent further complications and improve overall cardiovascular health.
