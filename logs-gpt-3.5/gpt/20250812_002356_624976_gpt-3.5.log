You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
    It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    sex (str): Patient's sex, either 'Female' or 'Male'.
    nursing_home_resident (bool): True if the patient is a nursing home resident, False otherwise.
    neoplastic_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of neoplastic disease, False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of liver disease, False otherwise.
    chf_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, False otherwise.
    cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of cerebrovascular disease, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of renal disease, False otherwise.
    altered_mental_status (bool): True if the patient has altered mental status, False otherwise.
    respiratory_rate (bool): True if respiratory rate is ≥30 breaths/min, False otherwise.
    systolic_bp (bool): True if systolic blood pressure is <90 mmHg, False otherwise.
    temperature (bool): True if temperature is <35°C or >39.9°C, False otherwise.
    pulse (bool): True if pulse rate is ≥125 beats/min, False otherwise.
    blood_ph (bool): True if blood pH is <7.35, False otherwise.
    bun (bool): True if BUN is ≥30 mg/dL or ≥11 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    sodium (bool): True if sodium level is <130 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    glucose (bool): True if glucose level is ≥250 mg/dL or ≥14 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    hematocrit (bool): True if hematocrit is <30%, False otherwise.
    oxygen_pressure (bool): True if partial pressure of oxygen is <60 mmHg or <8 kPa, False otherwise.
    pleural_effusion (bool): True if there is pleural effusion on x-ray, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    int: The total PSI/PORT Score indicating the severity of the pneumonia.}}

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Age:
   - In the reference text, the patient is described as "male, 1 year and 7 months old."
   - The age of the patient is 1 year and 7 months.
   - Therefore, the Age parameter is 1.

2. Sex:
   - In the reference text, the patient is identified as male.
   - Therefore, the Sex parameter is "Male".

3. Nursing Home Resident:
   - There is no mention of the patient being a nursing home resident in the reference text.
   - Since there is no information about nursing home residency, the parameter is False.

4. Neoplastic Disease:
   - There is no mention of the patient having a history of neoplastic disease in the reference text.
   - Since there is no information about neoplastic disease, the parameter is False.

5. Liver Disease:
   - There is no mention of the patient having a history of liver disease in the reference text.
   - Since there is no information about liver disease, the parameter is False.

6. CHF History (Congestive Heart Failure):
   - There is no mention of the patient having a history of congestive heart failure in the reference text.
   - Since there is no information about congestive heart failure, the parameter is False.

7. Cerebrovascular Disease:
   - There is no mention of the patient having a history of cerebrovascular disease in the reference text.
   - Since there is no information about cerebrovascular disease, the parameter is False.

8. Renal Disease:
   - There is no mention of the patient having a history of renal disease in the reference text.
   - Since there is no information about renal disease, the parameter is False.

9. Altered Mental Status:
   - There is no specific mention of altered mental status in the reference text.
   - However, based on the clinical presentation and history of convulsions, it can be inferred that the patient may have altered mental status.
   - Therefore, the parameter is True.

10. Respiratory Rate:
    - The respiratory rate of the patient is not explicitly given in the reference text.
    - Since there is no specific respiratory rate mentioned, we will assume a normal respiratory rate for a child of this age.
    - Therefore, the parameter is False.

11. Systolic BP:
    - The systolic blood pressure of the patient is described as "72/51 mmHg" in the reference text.
    - The systolic blood pressure is 72 mmHg, which is <90 mmHg.
    - Therefore, the parameter is True.

12. Temperature:
    - The temperature of the patient is described as "38.7°C" in the reference text.
    - The temperature is within the normal range.
    - Therefore, the parameter is False.

13. Pulse:
    - The pulse rate of the patient is described as "136 beats/min" in the reference text.
    - The pulse rate is ≥125 beats/min.
    - Therefore, the parameter is True.

14. Blood pH:
    - There is no mention of the patient's blood pH in the reference text.
    - Since there is no information about blood pH, the parameter is False.

15. BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen):
    - The BUN level of the patient is described as "5.6 mmol/L" in the reference text.
    - The BUN level is <30 mg/dL or <11 mmol/L.
    - Therefore, the parameter is False.

16. Sodium:
    - There is no mention of the patient's sodium level in the reference text.
    - Since there is no information about the sodium level, the parameter is False.

17. Glucose:
    - There is no mention of the patient's glucose level in the reference text.
    - Since there is no information about the glucose level, the parameter is False.

18. Hematocrit:
    - The hematocrit of the patient is described as "30%" in the reference text.
    - The hematocrit is <30%.
    - Therefore, the parameter is True.

19. Oxygen Pressure:
    - There is no mention of the patient's partial pressure of oxygen in the reference text.
    - Since there is no information about the oxygen pressure, the parameter is False.

20. Pleural Effusion:
    - There is no mention of pleural effusion on x-ray in the reference text.
    - Since there is no information about pleural effusion, the parameter is False.
