[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估房颤患者卒中风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病历信息，患者出现了心律失常，包括心室颤动、室性心动过速、室性期前收缩以及阵发性心房颤动。这些异常心律可能导致突发意识丧失和心电监护示心室颤动的情况。患者接受了心肺复苏和电除颤治疗后病情有所好转，最终通过经皮心脏自动复律除颤器安装术成功治疗。

这些心律失常可能影响了心脏的正常收缩和排血功能，导致出现意识丧失等症状。经过除颤治疗和安装心律管理器后，患者的病情得到了控制和好转。然而，需要进一步关注并管理患者的心律异常，以维持心脏功能和预防类似情况再次发生。
