[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于计算患者的肾小球滤过率（GFR）？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和辅助检查结果，可以看出患者可能存在肾小球肾炎，导致肉眼血尿、水肿、血压升高等症状。肾活检结果显示肾小球结构异常，包括纤维细胞性新月体形成、系膜区增宽和系膜基质增多等改变，同时免疫荧光显示多种免疫球蛋白和补体蛋白的颗粒状沉积，这可能导致肾小球滤过功能受损，引起肉眼血尿和水肿。同时，间质中还见到炎症细胞浸润和纤维化改变，可能导致肾功能异常，进一步导致血尿素氮和血肌酐升高。需要进一步治疗和管理肾脏疾病，以保护肾功能和预防进一步的损害。
