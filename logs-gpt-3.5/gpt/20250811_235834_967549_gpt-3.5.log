PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9): Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.


Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS): Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.

GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7): Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
    based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
    2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

    This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
    including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
    It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
    to assess and monitor treatment responses.

    Parameters:
    - nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
    - control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
    - worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
    - trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
    - restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
    - irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
    - fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

    int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

    Usage Example:
    gad_7_score = calculate_gad_7(3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
    print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score


Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:

        93.33333333333333

PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP: Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.

STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Calculate the STOP-BANG Score for screening Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

    This score is useful for patients undergoing preoperative evaluation but should not be used if a patient
    has already been diagnosed with OSA or uses CPAP at night. It helps in identifying patients who might have

    The NIHSS helps physicians quantify the severity of a stroke in the acute setting. 
    Increasing scores indicate a more severe stroke and correlate with the size of the infarction on both CT and MRI evaluation.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表被用于评估该患者抑郁症的严重程度？}}
Task Scenario: {{Based on the provided patient's case, the main abnormality appears to be severe major depressive disorder without psychotic symptoms. The patient has a history of worsening mood, sleep disturbances, excessive worrying, feelings of hopelessness, and suicidal ideation. Additionally, the patient exhibits physical symptoms such as rigidity in limbs and involuntary movements, which could indicate impairment in motor functions. The patient's refusal of treatment and lack of insight into their condition also suggest cognitive impairment and possible delusional thinking. The MRI results showing abnormalities in the frontal lobes and sinuses could be related to the patient's presenting symptoms but further evaluation is needed to determine the exact impact on bodily functions.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. The User Demand is asking for "哪一个量表被用于评估该患者抑郁症的严重程度？" which translates to "Which scale is used to assess the severity of depression in this patient?" This indicates a need for a tool related to assessing depression severity.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with severe major depressive disorder without psychotic symptoms, exhibiting symptoms such as worsening mood, sleep disturbances, excessive worrying, feelings of hopelessness, suicidal ideation, motor impairment, cognitive impairment, and delusional thinking. The patient also shows refusal of treatment and lack of insight into their condition, along with MRI abnormalities in the frontal lobes and sinuses.

3. From the provided tool list, the most suitable tool for assessing the severity of depression in this patient would be the "PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)".

4. The PHQ-9 is specifically designed to diagnose depression and quantify the severity of depression symptoms based on the nine criteria for major depressive disorder. It covers a range of symptoms including mood, sleep, energy levels, appetite, self-image, concentration, activity level, and suicidal thoughts.

5. By using the PHQ-9, the healthcare provider can accurately assess the severity of the patient's depressive symptoms, track changes over time, and determine the appropriate management and treatment plan.
