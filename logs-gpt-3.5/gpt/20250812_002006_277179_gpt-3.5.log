[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于计算高血糖患者的实际钠水平？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和辅助检查结果，可以推断患者患有糖尿病并发症，导致的神经病变引起了双下肢麻木刺痛。尿常规显示尿中白细胞增多，可能存在尿路感染。血液检查显示血糖和糖化血红蛋白均明显升高，提示糖尿病控制不佳。肝功能正常，说明糖尿病肾病尚未导致明显的肾功能损害。综上所述，病情主要涉及糖尿病的神经病变和尿路感染。
