[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于对上消化道出血患者进行风险评估和分层？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和临床诊断结果显示，患者患有十二指肠球部溃疡并出血，伴有失血性贫血。主要症状包括间断排黑便、头晕、心悸、乏力等。治疗方案中提到了内镜下十二指肠钛夹止血术，这进一步证实了溃疡出血的诊断。由于出血导致失血性贫血，患者可能存在贫血相关的症状，如乏力、心悸等。治疗后患者未再出现黑便，病情有好转。

根据血常规结果显示红细胞计数、血红蛋白浓度和红细胞压积值均下降，初次检查后的血红蛋白为95g/L，再次检查后下降至78g/L，这与失血性贫血的诊断一致。

最终的辅助检查结果显示粪便常规检查中隐血试验阳性，转铁蛋白也呈阳性，进一步确认了存在消化道出血的情况。

总体来看，患者的主要问题是十二指肠球部溃疡并出血导致的失血性贫血，可能会出现贫血相关的症状。治疗措施能够有效控制出血情况，病情有所缓解。
