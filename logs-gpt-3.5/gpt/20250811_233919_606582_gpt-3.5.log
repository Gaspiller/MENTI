You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}

- creatinine (float): Serum creatinine in mg/dL.
- urine_output (float): Urine output in mL/day.
- o2_delivery_type (int): Index of the type of oxygen delivery method used. Types are as follows: 0 = nasal cannula, 1 = simple face mask, 2 = non-rebreather mask, 3 = high-flow nasal cannula.

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Extract the value and unit for the pao2_fio2_ratio parameter:
   - The pao2_fio2_ratio is not directly mentioned in the Reference Text.
   - In the absence of a specific value, we need to infer the value based on normal physiological levels or common clinical scenarios.
   - A typical normal value for pao2_fio2_ratio is around 300-500 mmHg.
   - We can use 400 mmHg as a reasonable inferred value for the pao2_fio2_ratio parameter.
   - As the unit in the Function Docstring is specified as mmHg, we will use the same unit.

2. Extract the value and unit for the platelets parameter:
   - The platelets count is not specified in the Reference Text.
   - In the absence of a specific value, we need to infer the value based on typical physiological levels or common clinical scenarios.
   - A normal platelet count is around 150,000 to 450,000 × 10^3/µL.
   - We can use 300,000 × 10^3/µL as a reasonable inferred value for the platelets parameter.
   - As the unit in the Function Docstring is specified as ×10^3/µL, we will use the same unit.

3. Extract the value for the glasgow_coma_scale parameter:
   - The Glasgow Coma Scale score is not directly mentioned in the Reference Text.
   - It is stated that the patient is in a coma state and unresponsive to pain stimuli.
   - A patient who is unresponsive to pain stimuli typically has a Glasgow Coma Scale score of 3.
   - We will use a value of 3 for the glasgow_coma_scale parameter.

4. Extract the value and unit for the bilirubin parameter:
   - The serum bilirubin level is not directly mentioned in the Reference Text.
   - In the absence of a specific value, we need to infer the value based on common clinical scenarios.
   - A normal range for serum bilirubin is around 0.3 to 1.2 mg/dL.
   - We can use 0.8 mg/dL as a reasonable inferred value for the bilirubin parameter.
   - As the unit in the Function Docstring is specified as mg/dL, we will use the same unit.

5. Extract the value and unit for the map_pressure parameter:
   - The mean arterial pressure is mentioned in the Reference Text as BP: 160/90mmHg.
   - The mean arterial pressure (MAP) can be calculated as [(2 * diastolic) + systolic] / 3.
   - Using the provided blood pressure values, we can calculate the MAP: [(2 * 90) + 160] / 3 = 113.3 mmHg.
   - We will use a value of 113.3 mmHg for the map_pressure parameter.

6. Extract the value for the vasoactive_agents parameter:
   - There is no direct mention of vasoactive agents being used in the Reference Text.
   - In the absence of specific information, we can assume a value of 0 for no agents being used.

7. Extract the value and unit for the creatinine parameter:
   - The serum creatinine level is not directly mentioned in the Reference Text.
   - In the absence of a specific value, we need to infer the value based on common clinical scenarios.
   - A normal range for serum creatinine is around 0.6 to 1.2 mg/dL.
   - We can use 1.0 mg/dL as a reasonable inferred value for the creatinine parameter.
   - As the unit in the Function Docstring is specified as mg/dL, we will use the same unit.

8. Extract the value for the urine_output parameter:
   - The urine output is not specified in the Reference Text.
   - In the absence of specific information, we need to infer the value based on typical urinary output rates.
   - A normal urine output is around 0.5 to 1.5 mL/kg/hour in adults.
   - Considering the patient's condition, we can estimate a urine output of 0.5 mL/kg/hour.
   - Since the patient's weight is not provided, we will use a standard weight of 70 kg for estimation.
   - Calculating the urine output: 0.5 mL/kg/hour * 70 kg * 24 hours = 840 mL/day.
   - We will use a value of 840 mL/day for the urine_output parameter.

9. Extract the value for the o2_delivery_type parameter:
   - There is no clear mention of the type of oxygen delivery method used in the Reference Text.
   - In the absence of specific information, we can assume a value of 0 for nasal cannula.

10. Extract the value and unit for the o2_flow_rate parameter:
    - The flow rate of oxygen delivery is not specified in the Reference Text.
    - In the absence of specific information, we need to infer the value based on common clinical scenarios.
    - A typical flow rate for oxygen therapy can range from 1 to 15 L/min depending on the delivery method.
    - We can use 2 L/min as a reasonable inferred value for the o2_flow_rate parameter.
    - As the unit in the Function Docstring is specified as L/min, we will use the same unit.
