Detailed information of each tool: {{PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP: Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
    It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    sex (str): Patient's sex, either 'Female' or 'Male'.
    nursing_home_resident (bool): True if the patient is a nursing home resident, False otherwise.
    neoplastic_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of neoplastic disease, False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of liver disease, False otherwise.
    chf_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, False otherwise.
    cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of cerebrovascular disease, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of renal disease, False otherwise.
    altered_mental_status (bool): True if the patient has altered mental status, False otherwise.
    respiratory_rate (bool): True if respiratory rate is ≥30 breaths/min, False otherwise.
    systolic_bp (bool): True if systolic blood pressure is <90 mmHg, False otherwise.
    temperature (bool): True if temperature is <35°C or >39.9°C, False otherwise.

    Calculate the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.

    The CURB-65 calculator can be used in the emergency department setting to risk stratify a patient’s community acquired pneumonia.
    It includes points for confusion, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age.
    
    Parameters:
    confusion (int): Confusion status, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes.
    bun (int): Blood urea nitrogen status, where 0 = BUN ≤ 19 mg/dL (≤ 7 mmol/L urea) and 1 = BUN > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L urea).

    blood_pressure (int): Blood pressure status, where 0 = Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg, and 1 = Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg.
    age (int): Age status, where 0 = < 65 years and 1 = ≥ 65 years.

    Returns:
    int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

    Usage:
    This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.

    - prior_pe_or_dvt (bool): Whether the patient has a history of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) or Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). False for no, True for yes.
    - hormone_use (bool): Whether the patient is using hormones such as oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, or estrogenic hormones in male or female patients. False for no, True for yes.

    Returns:
    - result (bool): True if the patient can be ruled out for PE without further testing (all criteria negative), False otherwise.


Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator: Calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

    This function uses a standard method recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),
    which considers the first trimester ultrasound measurements to be the most accurate method to establish gestational age.

    Parameters:
    - cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
                           If cycle_length is more than 28, the difference is added to the 40-week period.
    - last_menstrual_period (str): The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

    Returns:
    - str: The estimated due date in the format 'Day, Month DD, YYYY'.

    Usage:
    The function is intended for use by healthcare providers to estimate due dates for pregnant patients,
    which can help in managing pregnancy timelines effectively and in planning medical care accordingly.

    Example:
    'Monday, Oct 16, 2023'

    Parameters:
    - dosages (list of float): List of dosages for each drug in the units appropriate for the drug
      (mcg/hr for fentanyl patches, mcg for fentanyl buccal/sublingual tablets, and mg for all other opioids).

User Demand: {{孕期预产期计算器可用于推算预产期，基于什么信息？}}
Task Scenario: {{根据病历显示，患者出现了胎膜早破的情况，这可以导致羊水漏出，增加孕妇和胎儿的感染风险。此外，胎膜早破也可能引起早产，需要密切监测胎儿情况以及预防感染。

由于胎膜早破引起了阴道流液，可以导致腹部疼痛、感染等并发症。因此，需要密切观察孕妇的症状，并及时采取必要的治疗措施。

除胎膜早破外，病史中还提到脐带绕颈的情况，这可能会影响胎儿的供氧情况，需要监测胎心音及胎动，并及时采取必要的处理措施。

总体而言，患者需要密切监测胎儿情况，防止感染，并在必要时进行紧急处理以确保母婴的安全。}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Based on the user demand and task scenario provided, the tool that seems most suitable to use is the Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator. This tool is used to calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

2. Since the scenario involves monitoring the pregnancy closely, assessing the risk of complications such as premature birth due to conditions like premature rupture of membranes and nuchal cord, and ensuring the safety of both the mother and the baby, knowing the estimated due date can help healthcare providers manage the pregnancy effectively.

3. By using the Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator, healthcare providers can estimate the due date and plan medical care accordingly to monitor the pregnancy progress, assess any risks, and take necessary interventions to prevent complications.
