You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)', 'Corrected QT Interval (QTc)', 'PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events:  Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    The QTc is used primarily to assess the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, especially torsades de pointes, 
    in patients with syncope or those receiving multiple QT-prolonging medications. A prolonged QT interval 
    can indicate a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This function corrects the QT interval to a heart rate 
    of 60 beats per minute, accounting for variations due to different heart rates.

    Parameters:

                       'Framingham', 'Hodges', and 'Rautaharju'.

    Returns:
        float: The corrected QT interval (QTc) in milliseconds.

    Example:
        >>> calculate_qtc(300, 70, 'Bazett')
        357.0

PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism: Calculate the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) to determine if further testing for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
    is unnecessary in patients considered low-risk.

    The PERC rule helps avoid unnecessary PE testing in low-risk patients. It requires that all criteria must be negative
    (i.e., all parameters must receive a 'no' to rule out PE without further testing).

    - age_over_50 (bool): Whether the patient is aged 50 or older. False for no, True for yes.
    - heart_rate_over_100 (bool): Whether the patient has a heart rate of 100 bpm or higher. False for no, True for yes.
    - oxygen_saturation_under_95 (bool): Whether the patient has an oxygen saturation less than 95%. False for no, True for yes.

    Returns:
    - result (bool): True if the patient can be ruled out for PE without further testing (all criteria negative), False otherwise.
