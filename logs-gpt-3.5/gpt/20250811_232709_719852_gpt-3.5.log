MELD Na (UNOS/OPTN): Calculate the MELD Na (UNOS/OPTN) score used to stratify patients ≥12 years old for liver transplant waitlists and predict mortality.
    The MELD Na score incorporates serum creatinine, bilirubin, INR, and sodium levels to determine the severity of liver dysfunction and predict three-month survival.

    Parameters:
    - creatinine (float): Serum creatinine in mg/dL. Minimum value used is 1.0. If patient's creatinine >4.0 or they received ≥2 dialysis treatments in the last 7 days or 24 hours of CVVHD, use 4.0.

    Returns:
    - meld_score (float): The calculated MELD Na score, capped at a maximum of 40.


Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.
    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.
 

Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA): Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA) using provided weight and height.

    BMI is a measure of body fat based on weight and height that applies to adult men and women.
    It can be misleading for very muscular individuals or in specific ethnic groups with different
    body compositions and statures.

    BSA is often used in medical settings to determine the dosages of medications that are more 
    accurately calculated using body surface area rather than weight.

    Parameters:
    - weight_kg (float): Weight of the individual in kilograms.
    - height_cm (float): Height of the individual in centimeters.

    Returns:
    - dict: Dictionary containing 'BMI' and 'BSA' with their respective values.

Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia: Calculate the corrected calcium level in patients with suspected hypocalcemia
    who have low albumin levels. Hypocalcemia might not be apparent if serum albumin is low,
    thus this formula adjusts the calcium level based on albumin discrepancy.

    Args:
    normal_albumin (float): The normal albumin level in g/dL assumed for the calculation.
    patient_albumin (float): The patient's measured albumin level in g/dL.
    serum_ca (float): The patient's measured serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: The corrected serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Example:
    >>> corrected_calcium(4.0, 3.2, 8.5)
    8.84
 

HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events:  Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7


ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications: Calculate the ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    spo2 (int): Preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) percentage.
    respiratory_infection (int): Indicates the presence of respiratory infection in the last month. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.

Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality: Calculate the Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality.

    The Child-Pugh Score helps estimate the prognosis for a patient with cirrhosis.
    Note that newer scores like the MELD and MELD-Na are generally preferred for their
    increased accuracy in prognosis.

    - albumin (float): Albumin level in g/dL.
    - inr (float): International Normalized Ratio.

    - int: The Child-Pugh Score, ranging from 5 (best) to 15 (worst).

CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk: Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
    - history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:

    9

HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance): Calculate the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).

    The HOMA-IR is a clinical tool used to estimate insulin resistance (IR), which can be
    indicative of potential glucose intolerance and diabetes. It is particularly useful
    in scenarios where more invasive and time-consuming methods like the clamp measurement
    (considered the gold standard for measuring IR) are not feasible. Although the HOMA-IR
    provides a reasonable correlation with clamp measurements, it is less accurate on an
    individual basis, which suggests a need for caution in its clinical application and
    interpretation.

    Parameters:
    - fasting_insulin (float): The fasting insulin level in uIU/mL.
    - fasting_glucose (float): The fasting glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR score).

    Formula:
    HOMA-IR score = (fasting insulin * fasting glucose) / 405
