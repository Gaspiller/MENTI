[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于预测患者在6周内发生重大心脏不良事件的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病历信息，主要异常为III度房室传导阻滞。这种心脏传导障碍导致心房和心室之间的电信号传导受阻，可能导致心跳不规律、心悸、乏力等症状。该情况需要通过起搏器植入来维持心律稳定。其他诊断包括高血压和高脂血症，这些情况可能增加心血管疾病风险。起搏器的植入可以彻底纠正III度传导阻滞，确保心脏节律稳定。
