You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications.
    This score helps predict the risk of pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery under general, neuraxial, or regional anesthesia.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    spo2 (int): Preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) percentage.
    respiratory_infection (int): Indicates the presence of respiratory infection in the last month. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
    anemia (int): Indicates preoperative anemia (Hgb ≤10 g/dL). 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
    surgical_incision (int): Type of surgical incision. 0 for 'Peripheral', 1 for 'Upper abdominal', 2 for 'Intrathoracic'.
    surgery_duration (int): Duration of the surgery in hours.
    emergency (int): Indicates if the procedure was an emergency. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.

    Returns:
    int: The ARISCAT score, which is a summation of points based on the provided parameters.

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Age:
   - In the reference text, it is mentioned that the patient is a 79-year-old male.
   - Therefore, the Age parameter value is 79.

2. Spo2:
   - There is no explicit mention of preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the reference text.
   - We can assume a standard value of 95% for Spo2.
   
3. Respiratory Infection:
   - There is no specific mention of respiratory infection in the reference text.
   - We can assume that since the patient's chief complaints were related to lung issues, there might be a recent respiratory infection.
   - Therefore, we can assume respiratory_infection as 1 (indicating 'Yes').

4. Anemia:
   - There is no direct mention of preoperative anemia in the reference text.
   - Since there is no clear information provided, we can assume that the patient does not have preoperative anemia.
   - Therefore, we can assume anemia as 0 (indicating 'No').

5. Surgical Incision:
   - There is no specific mention of the type of surgical incision in the reference text.
   - There is an indication of lung cancer and thoracic involvement, so we can assume that the surgical incision might be 'Intrathoracic'.
   - Therefore, we can assume surgical_incision as 2 (indicating 'Intrathoracic').

6. Surgery Duration:
   - There is no information regarding the duration of the surgery in the reference text.
   - We can assume a standard duration of 2 hours for the surgery.
   
7. Emergency:
   - There is no mention of whether the procedure was an emergency in the reference text.
   - Since the patient's condition seems to require urgent attention due to lung cancer, we can assume that the procedure might be considered emergency.
   - Therefore, we can assume emergency as 1 (indicating 'Yes').
