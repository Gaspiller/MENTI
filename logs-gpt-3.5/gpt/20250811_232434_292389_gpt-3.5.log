Detailed information of each tool: {{Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score: "Calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score which is used to assess the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.
The score is used to track a patient's status during their stay in an intensive care unit to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.

Parameters:

CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.


PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP: Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
    It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9): Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'

    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.

Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia: Calculate the Corrected Sodium for Hyperglycemia using Hillier's method from 1999.

    This function computes the corrected sodium level in patients with hyperglycemia,
    accounting for osmotic shifts of water from the intracellular to the extracellular space,
    which can lead to dilutional hyponatremia. The formula uses a correction factor of 2.4 mEq/L

    Returns:
        float: The corrected sodium level in mEq/L.

    Example:
        >>> sodium_correction_hyperglycemia(140, 200)
        142.4

CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity:

    The CURB-65 calculator can be used in the emergency department setting to risk stratify a patient’s community acquired pneumonia.
    It includes points for confusion, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age.
    
    Parameters:
    confusion (int): Confusion status, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes.
    bun (int): Blood urea nitrogen status, where 0 = BUN ≤ 19 mg/dL (≤ 7 mmol/L urea) and 1 = BUN > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L urea).
    respiratory_rate (int): Respiratory rate status, where 0 = < 30 breaths/min and 1 = ≥ 30 breaths/min.
    blood_pressure (int): Blood pressure status, where 0 = Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg, and 1 = Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg.
    age (int): Age status, where 0 = < 65 years and 1 = ≥ 65 years.

    Returns:
    int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

    Usage:
    This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.
    
    Example:
    >>> curb_65_score(1, 1, 1, 0, 1)
    4
   

MDRD GFR Equation: Calculate the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).
    This function estimates kidney function in patients with stable chronic kidney disease.
    It should not be used to assess acute renal failure or when GFR is >60 ml/min/m2 as it underestimates GFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_cr (float): Serum creatinine (Cr) level in mg/dL. Should be a positive float.
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years. Should be a non-negative integer.
    - race_index (int): Index representing the patient's race. 0 for non-black, 1 for black.
    - gender_index (int): Index representing the patient's gender. 0 for male, 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: Estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m2.

    The formula used:
    GFR = 175 × Serum Cr^{-1.154} × age^{-0.203} × 1.212 (if patient is black) × 0.742 (if female)


Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia: Calculate the corrected calcium level in patients with suspected hypocalcemia
    who have low albumin levels. Hypocalcemia might not be apparent if serum albumin is low,
    thus this formula adjusts the calcium level based on albumin discrepancy.

    Args:
    normal_albumin (float): The normal albumin level in g/dL assumed for the calculation.
    patient_albumin (float): The patient's measured albumin level in g/dL.
    serum_ca (float): The patient's measured serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: The corrected serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Example:
    >>> corrected_calcium(4.0, 3.2, 8.5)
    8.84
 

Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease: Calculate the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease in patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease history, diabetes, or intermittent claudication.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
    - sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
    - total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    Returns:
    float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.
