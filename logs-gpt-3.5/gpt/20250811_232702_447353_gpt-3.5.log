[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的肺炎严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者提供的病史和体征，可以推测患者可能患有喘息性支气管炎并合并左侧肺门处肿块形成。这可能导致患者出现持续的咳嗽、咳痰和气喘症状，并且在活动后加重。肿块形成可能对左下肺呼吸音造成影响，导致呼吸音减弱。辅助检查显示BUN值较低，这可能与患者的肺部疾病有关，但具体影响有待进一步诊断。建议进一步进行相关检查以明确诊断并进行治疗。
