You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7)', 'HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP', 'NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS)', 'STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity', 'Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS)', "Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism"]}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9): Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.

    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
    2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

    This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
    including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
    It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
    to assess and monitor treatment responses.

         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:

Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS): Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:

      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)

      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.

Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism: Calculates the Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism (PE).
    
    This function estimates the pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism based on certain clinical criteria.

    Parameters:
    dvt_symptoms (bool): True if there are clinical signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), else False.
    pe_diagnosis (bool): True if pulmonary embolism is the #1 diagnosis or equally likely, else False.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表被用于评估患者抑郁症的严重程度？}}
Task Scenario: {{Based on the provided patient's case, the main abnormality observed is severe depression that initially manifested as emotional distress, lack of interest, social withdrawal, insomnia, decreased appetite, and frequent crying spells. The patient's clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe depression is supported by symptoms such as low mood, irritability, difficulty in concentrating, and feelings of hopelessness.

The impaired bodily functions in this case are likely related to mental health issues, specifically affecting the patient's emotional well-being, cognitive functions, and sleep patterns. The patient's symptoms of insomnia, decreased appetite, and emotional instability indicate potential disruptions in neurotransmitter functions and mood regulation.

The treatment with antidepressant medications like Quetiapine and Sertraline, along with psychosocial support, points towards addressing the chemical imbalances in the brain and restoring emotional stability. The patient's response to the treatment, with stable condition, suggests that the medication is effectively targeting the underlying neurological mechanisms contributing to depression.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. The User Demand is asking which tool is used to assess the severity of depression in patients.
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient exhibiting symptoms of moderate to severe depression, including emotional distress, lack of interest, social withdrawal, insomnia, decreased appetite, and frequent crying spells.
3. The provided information suggests that the patient is undergoing treatment with antidepressant medications like Quetiapine and Sertraline, along with psychosocial support, and showing a stable condition in response to the treatment.
4. The tool best suited for assessing the severity of depression based on the symptoms exhibited by the patient is the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9).
5. The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale specifically used to diagnose depression and quantify the severity of depression symptoms based on the DSM criteria for major depressive disorder.
6. The parameters of the PHQ-9 include evaluating symptoms related to interest/pleasure, feeling down, sleep issues, tiredness, appetite, self-feelings, concentration, activity level, and suicidal thoughts.
7. By inputting the scores for each parameter based on the patient's symptoms, we can calculate the total PHQ-9 score to assess the severity of the patient's depression.
8. The provided patient's case aligns with the use of the PHQ-9 tool for evaluating the severity of depression symptoms and monitoring the treatment response.
9. Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List for this scenario is the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9).
