You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. Your task is to transform the user's input search query into several similar queries, thereby helping the user to retrieve more useful information.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must be closely related to the input search query.
2. The generated queries must not alter the user's original intent.
3. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
4. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
5. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

Begin!

doctor input search query: The history_of_severe_organ_insufficiency value needs to be provided, and it should be an integer indicating the patient's history status as described in the Function Docstring.

[output]  ```json
[
    "What is severe organ insufficiency history value in integer format according to the Function Docstring?",
    "Please provide the patient's history status as described in the Function Docstring for severe organ insufficiency.",
    "What integer value indicates the history of severe organ insufficiency in patients, as per the Function Docstring?"
]
```
