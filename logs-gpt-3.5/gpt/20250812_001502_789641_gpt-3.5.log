[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于计算高血糖患者的实际钠水平？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病史和辅助检查结果，患者被诊断为2型糖尿病并伴有口干、口渴症状。患者因血糖控制不佳导致双侧胫腓骨破溃，可能存在神经和血管并发症。此外，患者还有高血压病史、脑梗死病史和白内障手术史，可能存在心血管系统和视觉系统的问题。肝功能检查正常，但血液中的甘油三酯水平升高，可能存在脂代谢紊乱。需要进一步关注患者的血糖控制、神经血管情况和心血管系统健康。
