[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者10年内冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病发作风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病历资料分析，患者出现急性左心衰竭、冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病和缺血性心肌病的临床诊断，血钾值偏低，心电图显示ST压低，T波低平或倒置，心脏超声显示左室舒张功能减低，这些表明患者心脏功能受损且可能存在心肌缺血。除此之外，患者有慢性支气管炎急性发作的病史，可能导致呼吸系统功能受损。综上所述，患者的心脏和呼吸系统功能可能受损，需要针对心衰和缺血性心脏病等方面进行治疗。
