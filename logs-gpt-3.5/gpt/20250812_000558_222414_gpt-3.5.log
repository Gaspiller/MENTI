You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
    It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    sex (str): Patient's sex, either 'Female' or 'Male'.
    nursing_home_resident (bool): True if the patient is a nursing home resident, False otherwise.
    neoplastic_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of neoplastic disease, False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of liver disease, False otherwise.
    chf_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, False otherwise.
    cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of cerebrovascular disease, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of renal disease, False otherwise.
    altered_mental_status (bool): True if the patient has altered mental status, False otherwise.
    respiratory_rate (bool): True if respiratory rate is ≥30 breaths/min, False otherwise.
    systolic_bp (bool): True if systolic blood pressure is <90 mmHg, False otherwise.
    temperature (bool): True if temperature is <35°C or >39.9°C, False otherwise.
    pulse (bool): True if pulse rate is ≥125 beats/min, False otherwise.
    blood_ph (bool): True if blood pH is <7.35, False otherwise.
    bun (bool): True if BUN is ≥30 mg/dL or ≥11 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    sodium (bool): True if sodium level is <130 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    glucose (bool): True if glucose level is ≥250 mg/dL or ≥14 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    hematocrit (bool): True if hematocrit is <30%, False otherwise.
    oxygen_pressure (bool): True if partial pressure of oxygen is <60 mmHg or <8 kPa, False otherwise.
    pleural_effusion (bool): True if there is pleural effusion on x-ray, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    int: The total PSI/PORT Score indicating the severity of the pneumonia.}}

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  Step By Step Analysis:

1. Analyzing the age:
   - The reference text states that the patient is a 71-year-old female.
   - Therefore, the age parameter is 71 years.

2. Analyzing the sex:
   - The reference text states that the patient is female.
   - Therefore, the sex parameter is Female.

3. Analyzing the nursing_home_resident:
   - There is no information in the reference text indicating whether the patient is a nursing home resident or not.
   - Based on the absence of information, we fill the nursing_home_resident parameter randomly. Let's assume it's False.

4. Analyzing the neoplastic_disease:
   - There is no information in the reference text indicating whether the patient has a history of neoplastic disease.

7. Analyzing the cerebrovascular_disease:
   - There is no information in the reference text indicating whether the patient has a history of cerebrovascular disease.
   - Based on the absence of information, we fill the cerebrovascular_disease parameter randomly. Let's assume it's False.

8. Analyzing the renal_disease:
   - There is no information in the reference text indicating whether the patient has a history of renal disease.
   - Based on the absence of information, we fill the renal_disease parameter randomly. Let's assume it's False.

9. Analyzing the altered_mental_status:
   - There is no information in the reference text indicating whether the patient has altered mental status.
   - Based on the absence of information, we fill the altered_mental_status parameter randomly. Let's assume it's False.

10. Analyzing the respiratory_rate:
    - There is no specific value in the reference text for the respiratory rate parameter.
    - Based on the scoring rules in the function docstring, the respiratory rate should be considered False unless explicitly stated otherwise in the reference text.

11. Analyzing the systolic_bp:
    - The reference text states that the systolic blood pressure is 122 mmHg.
    - Therefore, the systolic_bp parameter is <90 mmHg, which means True.

12. Analyzing the temperature:
    - The temperature of the patient in the reference text is 37°C, which does not meet the criteria for <35°C or >39.9°C for this parameter.
    - Therefore, the temperature parameter is False.

13. Analyzing the pulse:
    - The reference text states that the pulse rate is 100 beats/min, which does not meet the criteria for ≥125 beats/min for this parameter.
    - Therefore, the pulse parameter is False.

14. Analyzing the blood_ph:
    - There is no specific value for blood pH in the reference text.
    - Based on the scoring rules in the function docstring, the blood pH should be considered False unless explicitly stated otherwise in the reference text.

15. Analyzing the bun:
    - The reference text states that BUN is 15 mg/dL, which does not meet the criteria for ≥30 mg/dL for this parameter.
    - Therefore, the bun parameter is False.

16. Analyzing the sodium:
    - The reference text states that the blood sodium level is 138 mmol/L, which does not meet the criteria for <130 mmol/L for this parameter.
    - Therefore, the sodium parameter is False.

17. Analyzing the glucose:
    - The reference text states that the blood glucose level is 7.0 mmol/L, which does not meet the criteria for ≥250 mg/dL for this parameter.
    - Therefore, the glucose parameter is False.

18. Analyzing the hematocrit:
    - The reference text states that the blood hematocrit is 42%, which does not meet the criteria for <30% for this parameter.
    - Therefore, the hematocrit parameter is False.

19. Analyzing the oxygen_pressure:
    - The reference text states that the partial pressure of oxygen is 92 mmHg, which does not meet the criteria for <60 mmHg for this parameter.
    - Therefore, the oxygen_pressure parameter is False.

20. Analyzing the pleural_effusion:
    - There is no information in the reference text indicating the presence of pleural effusion.
    - Based on the absence of information, we fill the pleural_effusion parameter randomly. Let's assume it's False.
