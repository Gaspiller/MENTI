You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance)', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA)', 'Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk', 'MDRD GFR Equation', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity', 'STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance): Calculate the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).

    The HOMA-IR is a clinical tool used to estimate insulin resistance (IR), which can be
    indicative of potential glucose intolerance and diabetes. It is particularly useful
    in scenarios where more invasive and time-consuming methods like the clamp measurement
    (considered the gold standard for measuring IR) are not feasible. Although the HOMA-IR
    provides a reasonable correlation with clamp measurements, it is less accurate on an
    individual basis, which suggests a need for caution in its clinical application and
    interpretation.

    Parameters:
    - fasting_insulin (float): The fasting insulin level in uIU/mL.
    - fasting_glucose (float): The fasting glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR score).

    Formula:
    HOMA-IR score = (fasting insulin * fasting glucose) / 405

Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score: "Calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score which is used to assess the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.
The score is used to track a patient's status during their stay in an intensive care unit to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.

Parameters:
- pao2_fio2_ratio (float): The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (mmHg).
- platelets (float): Platelet count in ×103/µL.
- glasgow_coma_scale (int): Score on the Glasgow Coma Scale.
- bilirubin (float): Serum bilirubin in mg/dL.
- map_pressure (float): Mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
- vasoactive_agents (int): Index indicating the vasoactive agents being used. Corresponds to 0 for no agents, 1 for low dose dopamine or any dose dobutamine, 2 for higher dose dopamine or low dose epinephrine/norepinephrine, 3 for very high dose of these agents.
- creatinine (float): Serum creatinine in mg/dL.
- urine_output (float): Urine output in mL/day.
- o2_delivery_type (int): Index of the type of oxygen delivery method used. Types are as follows: 0 = nasal cannula, 1 = simple face mask, 2 = non-rebreather mask, 3 = high-flow nasal cannula.
- o2_flow_rate (float): Flow rate of oxygen delivery in L/min.

Returns:
int: Total SOFA score which is the sum of individual scores across the specified parameters."

Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA): Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA) using provided weight and height.

    BMI is a measure of body fat based on weight and height that applies to adult men and women.
    It can be misleading for very muscular individuals or in specific ethnic groups with different
    body compositions and statures.

    BSA is often used in medical settings to determine the dosages of medications that are more 
    accurately calculated using body surface area rather than weight.

    Parameters:
    - weight_kg (float): Weight of the individual in kilograms.
    - height_cm (float): Height of the individual in centimeters.

    Returns:
    - dict: Dictionary containing 'BMI' and 'BSA' with their respective values.

Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS): Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.
    
    Parameters:
    - hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
    - bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

    Returns:
    - int: Glasgow-Blatchford Score, ranging from 0 to 23.

    This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.


HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk: Calculate the HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.

    Returns:
    int: The total HAS-BLED score, which is a sum of all applicable risk factors.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_has_bled_score(True, False, False, True, False, True, True, False, True)
    5

MDRD GFR Equation: Calculate the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).
    This function estimates kidney function in patients with stable chronic kidney disease.
    It should not be used to assess acute renal failure or when GFR is >60 ml/min/m2 as it underestimates GFR.

    Parameters:

    4
   

STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Calculate the STOP-BANG Score for screening Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

    This score is useful for patients undergoing preoperative evaluation but should not be used if a patient
    has already been diagnosed with OSA or uses CPAP at night. It helps in identifying patients who might have
    OSA and are at increased risk of perioperative cardiopulmonary complications, as well as other morbidity
    associated with OSA like daytime sleepiness and cardiopulmonary conditions.

    Parameters:
    - snore_loudly (bool): True if the patient snores loudly (louder than talking or loud enough to be heard through closed doors), False otherwise.
    - feel_tired_daytime (bool): True if the patient often feels tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime, False otherwise.
    - observed_apnea (bool): True if anyone has observed the patient stop breathing during sleep, False otherwise.
    - high_blood_pressure (bool): True if the patient has or is being treated for high blood pressure, False otherwise.

    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - neck_circumference (float): Neck circumference of the patient in centimeters.
    - gender (str): Gender of the patient. Expected values: 'Female' or 'Male'.

    Returns:
    int: The total STOP-BANG score, ranging from 0 to 8.

    Usage:
    >>> calculate_stop_bang_score(True, True, True, True, 36, 51, 41, 'Male')
    8

Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity: Calculate the Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity using the Smithline-Gardner Formula.

    This function calculates the serum osmolality/osmolarity based on the concentrations of sodium, glucose,
    and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the blood. Serum osmolality is a measure of the solute concentration in the blood,
    and it can be used to assess the body's fluid and electrolyte balance. An osmolar gap (difference between measured
    and expected osmolality) greater than 10 can indicate the presence of certain toxic alcohols, mannitol, or propylene glycol.

    Note: At extreme levels of serum glucose, such as in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), the osmolar gap may be skewed,
    and clinical judgment should be used.

    Parameters:
    serum_na (float): Serum sodium concentration in mmol/L. Typical reference range is 135-145 mmol/L.
    serum_glucose (float): Serum glucose concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 70-100 mg/dL.
    serum_bun (float): Blood urea nitrogen concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 7-20 mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: Calculated serum osmolality in mOsm/kg.

    Formula:
    Serum Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 2 * (serum_na) + (serum_glucose / 18) + (serum_bun / 2.8)

User Demand: {{哪一个量表被用于评估上消化道出血患者的出血风险和适合门诊治疗的可能性？}}
Task Scenario: {{根据患者的病史和临床表现，可以初步推断患者的主要问题是急性上消化道出血导致的失血性休克和重度贫血。血常规和血红蛋白水平的显著降低以及血气分析中血红蛋白和血乳酸的异常值均支持这一推断。此外，患者的呕血症状和消化道出血病史也进一步证实了这一点。

在这种情况下，失血性休克可能导致机体循环功能受损，进而影响全身组织器官的供氧和代谢功能。同时，重度贫血会影响氧气的输送和细胞的代谢活动。需立即采取止血和输血等治疗措施，并密切监测患者的病情变化和器官功能，以防止进一步的损害。}}
