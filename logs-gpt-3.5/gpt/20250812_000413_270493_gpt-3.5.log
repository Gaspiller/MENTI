[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

Patient Case Analysis:

Based on the provided patient's case, the main abnormal part is the left lower lung pneumonia as shown on the chest X-ray. This indicates an infection in the lung, which can impair respiratory function and lead to symptoms like fever, cough, and difficulty breathing. The patient also has a slightly elevated blood urea nitrogen (15mg/dl), which may indicate impaired kidney function. The normal blood glucose level (5.0mmol/L) suggests no issues with glucose metabolism. The overall picture suggests an acute respiratory infection affecting the lungs and potential kidney involvement due to the infection.
