[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估ICU患者的严重程度和预测死亡率？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和检查结果显示，患儿表现出发热、抽搐、代谢性酸中毒合并呼吸性碱中毒、高乳酸血症等症状，血气分析结果显示PH值偏高，呈现代谢性酸中毒，同时伴有高乳酸血症。这可能意味着患儿存在着异常的代谢功能和呼吸功能。由于患者呈现神志萎靡等症状，可能还存在神经系统的受损，导致抽搐和意识障碍等症状。总体来说，这些症状表明患儿可能存在多个器官功能受损，需要进一步诊断和治疗。
