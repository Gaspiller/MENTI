[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的肾小球滤过率？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和体格检查结果，可以初步推断患者可能患有IgA肾病。这推测得到进一步证实的支持，如尿液分析显示蛋白尿和隐血阳性，血液分析显示肾功能异常，尿蛋白定量证实蛋白尿存在，并且经过肾穿刺活检病理确诊为IgA肾病。IgA肾病可能导致肾脏功能受损，出现尿液异常现象，如蛋白尿和血尿, 并可能出现浮肿等症状。
