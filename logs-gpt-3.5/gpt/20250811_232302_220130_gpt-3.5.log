You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估肾小球滤过率，特别适用于男性患者，以评估肾功能及预后？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和辅助检查结果，可以看出患者主要存在慢性肾功能不全尿毒症期。患者的血肌酐和血尿素均升高，血常规显示贫血，以及肌红蛋白升高，这些指标表明肾功能受损。此外，B型脑钠肽水平升高也提示肾脏功能不全。慢性肾功能不全可能导致贫血、电解质紊乱等并发症，需要持续血液透析治疗来维持生命。

另外，患者还存在肺炎和陈旧性心肌梗死的情况。肺部CT显示双侧胸腔积液和心包积液，结合临床诊断的肺炎和心脏疾病，可能存在心脏和肺部功能受损的情况。心脏支架植入手术后的心肌梗死可能导致心功能不全，需要进行对症治疗来稳定病情。

综合来看，患者可能存在肾功能不全导致的贫血、电解质紊乱等问题，以及肺炎和心脏病所致的心肺功能受损，需要继续血液透析治疗和对症治疗来改善病情。
