You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
    based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
    2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

    This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
    including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
    It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
    to assess and monitor treatment responses.

    Parameters:
    - nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
    - control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
    - worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
    - trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
    - restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
    - irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
    - fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

    Returns:
    int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

    Usage Example:
    gad_7_score = calculate_gad_7(3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
    print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Analyze parameter "nervous":
   From the Reference Text, we can infer that the patient has been feeling nervous and anxious, which aligns with the scoring for the "nervous" parameter in the Function Docstring. The patient shows signs of anxiety, so we can assume a relatively high score for this parameter.
   
2. Analyze parameter "control_worrying":
   Although it is not explicitly mentioned in the Reference Text, we can infer that the patient's inability to stop or control worrying may be present, given the anxiety symptoms described. Thus, we can assign a moderate score to this parameter.

3. Analyze parameter "worry_too_much":
   The patient worrying too much about different things is not directly stated in the Reference Text. However, considering the overall anxiety symptoms presented by the patient, we can assume a moderate score for this parameter.

4. Analyze parameter "trouble_relaxing":
   The patient is described as having trouble relaxing, which directly correlates with the "trouble_relaxing" parameter in the Function Docstring. Therefore, we can assign a high score to this parameter.

5. Analyze parameter "restlessness":
   The description of the patient being restless and unable to sit still matches the "restlessness" parameter in the Function Docstring. Therefore, we can assume a high score for this parameter.

6. Analyze parameter "irritability":
   The patient is mentioned to be easily annoyed or irritable, indicating a presence of irritability. Consequently, we can attribute a high score to this parameter.

7. Analyze parameter "fear_of_awful_events":
   The patient is described as feeling afraid, suggesting a fear of awful events. This aligns with the "fear_of_awful_events" parameter in the Function Docstring, so we can assign a moderate score for this parameter.

    "nervous": {"Value": 2, "Unit": "null"},
