[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估患者的肝纤维化程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的患者病史和辅助检查结果，可以得出以下结论：
1. 右肾囊肿：患者被诊断出右肾囊肿，可能导致右腰部胀痛不适。
2. 慢性病毒性乙型肝炎：患者被诊断出慢性病毒性乙型肝炎，表现在肝功能检查中出现TBIL、AST、ALP等指标升高，可能影响肝脏功能。
3. 肝功能不全（腹水期）：由于肝功能异常，可能导致腹腔积液的产生，需要密切监测病情并进行相应的治疗。
在治疗上，对囊肿进行切除和腹膜后引流管的置入可能有助于患者病情的好转。
根据病历中提到的皮下气肿的麻醉处理，可能要考虑患者的体液平衡和手术后感染的预防。
