[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估酒精性肝硬化患者的肝功能程度和预后风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病历显示，患者患有酒精性肝硬化和门静脉性胆道病致慢加急性肝衰竭，存在肝衰竭的表现，如黄疸、尿黄等。血液生化指标显示肝功能异常，TBil和DBil升高，肌酐水平也略高，说明肝脏和肾脏功能可能受损。凝血常规和血小板计数异常，提示凝血功能可能受到影响。此外，肝胆脾多排CT显示肝硬化，脾大，门静脉高压，胆囊多发结石等问题，这些异常部分说明肝脏、胆道系统和循环系统可能存在问题。治疗方案中提到行肝移植手术，进一步证实了肝功能受损且需要进一步治疗。
