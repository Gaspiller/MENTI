[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的平均动脉压（MAP）？

Patient Case Analysis:

主要问题在于风湿性心脏病和脂肪瘤术后引起的症状。根据病史和体格检查结果，患者出现胸闷、气短、咳嗽、咳痰等症状，心电图显示心房颤动和频发多源性室性早搏，心脏彩超显示 EF 68%、重度二尖瓣狭窄、轻度反流，这些指标提示了心功能异常，可能导致气短、胸闷等症状。同时，手术治疗过程可能引起身体反应或并发症，需要密切关注术后恢复状况。治疗方案包括利尿、改善心功能、控制心率等，有望改善症状和预后。
