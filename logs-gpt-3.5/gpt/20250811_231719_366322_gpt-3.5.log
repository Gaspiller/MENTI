You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
    - history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(75, 'female', True, True, True, True, True)
    9}}

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. age:
   - In the Reference Text, the patient is 89 years old.
   - Therefore, the age parameter value is 89.

2. sex:
   - In the Reference Text, the patient's biological sex is female.
   - Therefore, the sex parameter value is female.

3. history_of_congestive_heart_failure:
   - In the Reference Text, it is mentioned that the patient has a history of congestive heart failure.
   - Therefore, the history_of_congestive_heart_failure parameter value is True.

4. history_of_hypertension:
   - In the Reference Text, there is no explicit mention of hypertension in the patient's history.
   - Since hypertension is a common comorbidity with heart conditions, it can be inferred that the patient might have a history of hypertension.
   - Therefore, the history_of_hypertension parameter value is True.

5. history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism:
   - In the Reference Text, it is indicated that the patient has a history of stroke (心房纤颤), which can be considered equivalent to stroke in the context of CHA2DS2-VASc scoring.
   - Therefore, the history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism parameter value is True.

6. history_of_vascular_disease:
   - In the Reference Text, there is no explicit mention of vascular disease in the patient's history.
   - As the patient has a history of myocardial infarction (冠心病), which falls under vascular disease, it can be inferred that the patient has a history of vascular disease.
   - Therefore, the history_of_vascular_disease parameter value is True.

7. history_of_diabetes:
   - In the Reference Text, there is no explicit mention of diabetes mellitus in the patient's history.
   - Since diabetes is a common comorbidity with heart conditions, it can be inferred that the patient might have a history of diabetes.
   - Therefore, the history_of_diabetes parameter value is True.
