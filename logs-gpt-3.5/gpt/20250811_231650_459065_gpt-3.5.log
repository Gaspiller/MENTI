Detailed information of each tool: {{Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.
    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  Based on the User Demand to assess the likelihood of streptococcal pharyngitis in children, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the "Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis."

Step 1: Analyze the symptoms in the task scenario:
- The child presents with symptoms of fever and cough, along with lung findings of inflammatory changes in the right upper lobe, supporting the clinical diagnosis of bronchopneumonia.
- Blood tests show a reduced neutrophil count, indicating a potential immune function impairment and increased infection risk.
- Echocardiography reveals normal cardiac function but suggests mild tricuspid and mitral valve regurgitation, indicating possible myocardial damage requiring further attention.

Step 2: Select the appropriate tool:
- The "Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis" is designed to assess the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) pharyngitis, which aligns with the user demand for evaluating streptococcal infection in children with pharyngitis symptoms.

Therefore, the chosen tool is the "Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis."
