You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA)', 'APACHE II Score', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk', 'Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)', 'Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis', 'CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events:  Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)

    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.

    accurately calculated using body surface area rather than weight.

    Parameters:
    - weight_kg (float): Weight of the individual in kilograms.

    This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.


Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.

    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.
 

CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.
