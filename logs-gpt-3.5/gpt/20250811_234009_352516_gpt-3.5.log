[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的意识状态和昏迷程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病例信息，患者因服用安眠药（安定）大量入院，出现呼吸循环抑制导致昏迷状态，瞳孔对光反射均迟钝，可能存在神经系统功能受损，可能涉及脑干功能受损导致意识模糊，视觉、听觉功能受损。此外，患者在查体中四肢肌张力低，肌力不合作，可能存在肌肉功能受损的表现。辅助检查中凝血五项和生化指标异常，可能存在凝血功能障碍及肝脏功能异常。综合分析患者可能存在神经系统、肌肉功能和凝血功能受损等问题。

[output]  ```json
[
    "除了昏迷程度，患者可能存在神经系统功能受损及凝血功能异常，应当关注这些问题。",
    "是否有特定量表可同时评估患者的神经系统功能及凝血功能？",
    "患者可能存在肌肉功能受损的情况，量表评估是否应考虑这一点？"
]
