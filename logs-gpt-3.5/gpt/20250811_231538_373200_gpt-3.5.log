    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.

Wells' Criteria for DVT: Calculate the Wells' Criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).

    This scale helps clinicians in outpatient and emergency settings to stratify patients' risk of DVT.
