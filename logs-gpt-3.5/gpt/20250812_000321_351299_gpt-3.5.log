You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk', 'Corrected QT Interval (QTc)', 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)', 'Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events:  Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,

        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk: Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
 

Corrected QT Interval (QTc): Calculate the Corrected QT Interval (QTc) for a patient.

    The QTc is used primarily to assess the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, especially torsades de pointes, 
    in patients with syncope or those receiving multiple QT-prolonging medications. A prolonged QT interval 
    can indicate a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This function corrects the QT interval to a heart rate 
    of 60 beats per minute, accounting for variations due to different heart rates.

    Parameters:
        qt_interval (float): The measured QT interval in milliseconds.
        heart_rate (float): The patient's heart rate in beats per minute.
        formula (str): The formula to use for correction. Options are 'Bazett', 'Fridericia', 
                       'Framingham', 'Hodges', and 'Rautaharju'.

    Returns:
        float: The corrected QT interval (QTc) in milliseconds.

    Example:
        >>> calculate_qtc(300, 70, 'Bazett')
        357.0

Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease: Calculate the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease in patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease history, diabetes, or intermittent claudication.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
    - sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.

    - bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    Returns:
    float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.


PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9): Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.


Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
