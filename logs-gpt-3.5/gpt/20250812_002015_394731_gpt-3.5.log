You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)', 'NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS)', 'Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'MDRD GFR Equation', 'PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)', 'Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA)', 'HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7)']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.


NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS): 
    Calculate the NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS).

    The NIHSS helps physicians quantify the severity of a stroke in the acute setting. 
    Increasing scores indicate a more severe stroke and correlate with the size of the infarction on both CT and MRI evaluation.
    Scores assessed within the first 48 hours following a stroke have been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes at the 3-month and 1-year mark.

Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation): 
    Calculate the Creatinine Clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation.

    This function estimates kidney function, useful for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) staging
    and adjusting or discontinuing medications based on kidney function. It incorporates
    the patient's age, weight, sex, and serum creatinine levels to calculate the clearance rate.
    This is particularly relevant when considering medication dosages for patients with reduced
    kidney function, despite potential overestimations in GFR with newer creatinine assays.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Should be a positive integer.
    - weight (float): The weight of the patient in kilograms. Should be a positive decimal.
    - creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level in mg/dL. Should be a positive decimal.
    - sex (str): The sex of the patient. Acceptable values are 'male' or 'female'.
                 This affects the calculation as there is a different multiplier for females.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated creatinine clearance in mL/min.
    
    Example:
    >>> calculate_creatinine_clearance(50, 70, 1.2, 'female')
    49.30555555555556

MDRD GFR Equation: Calculate the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).
    This function estimates kidney function in patients with stable chronic kidney disease.
    It should not be used to assess acute renal failure or when GFR is >60 ml/min/m2 as it underestimates GFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_cr (float): Serum creatinine (Cr) level in mg/dL. Should be a positive float.
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years. Should be a non-negative integer.

    Returns:
    - float: Estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m2.

    The formula used:
    GFR = 175 × Serum Cr^{-1.154} × age^{-0.203} × 1.212 (if patient is black) × 0.742 (if female)


PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9): Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.


Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA): Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA) using provided weight and height.

    BMI is a measure of body fat based on weight and height that applies to adult men and women.
    It can be misleading for very muscular individuals or in specific ethnic groups with different
    body compositions and statures.

    BSA is often used in medical settings to determine the dosages of medications that are more 
    accurately calculated using body surface area rather than weight.

    Parameters:
    - weight_kg (float): Weight of the individual in kilograms.
    - height_cm (float): Height of the individual in centimeters.

    Returns:
    - dict: Dictionary containing 'BMI' and 'BSA' with their respective values.

    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,

    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. 根据用户需求，用户需要找出用于计算高血糖患者实际钠水平的量表。
2. 从工具列表中找到适合的工具来处理这个需求。
3. CKD-EPI方程可以用于估计肾功能，尤其适用于慢性肾病患者。这个方程使用肌酐基准方程来估计肾功能。
