    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.

Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.
    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.
 

Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease: Calculate the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease in patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease history, diabetes, or intermittent claudication.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
    - sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
    - total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    Returns:
    float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.
