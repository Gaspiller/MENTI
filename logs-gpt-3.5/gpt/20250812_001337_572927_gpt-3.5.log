[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估非心脏手术后心脏并发症的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病例信息，患者的主要异常部分是右侧髌骨骨折和冠心病心功能Ⅱ级。右侧髌骨骨折可能导致右侧膝关节疼痛，肿胀，活动受限。对应的神经阻滞治疗可能有助于缓解症状。另外，冠心病的心功能减低、主动脉瓣和二尖瓣狭窄以及返流等情况也需要关注。这些情况可能会影响患者的心脏功能，需要进一步监测和治疗以维持心脏健康。
