You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者在进行利凡诺穿刺引产术前的心脏风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:
The main abnormal part of the patient's case is the high risk of trisomy 18 detected through non-invasive DNA screening. Trisomy 18, also known as Edwards syndrome, is a genetic disorder caused by the presence of an extra chromosome 18. This abnormality can lead to severe developmental delays, congenital heart defects, and other organ malformations. In the case of this patient, the decision to terminate the pregnancy was made due to the high risk of trisomy 18, indicating a concern for the potential impairment of fetal development and organ functions associated with this genetic condition.

    "What is the specific scale employed to gauge the patient's heart risks before undergoing amniocentesis for pregnancy termination?"
