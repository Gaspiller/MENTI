You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
    based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
    2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

    This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
    including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
    It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
    to assess and monitor treatment responses.

    Parameters:
    - nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
    - control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
    - worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
    - trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
    - restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
    - irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
    - fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

    Returns:
    int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

    Usage Example:
    gad_7_score = calculate_gad_7(3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
    print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Parameter: nervous
   - Value: The patient is described as "兴奋话多" (excited speech), "自我感觉良好" (feeling good about oneself), "继续交谈" (continuously talking), "精力旺盛" (energetic), "称自己要积极向上" (claiming to be positive), and "称自己可以预见未来" (claiming to foresee the future). These indicate a somewhat positive and excited mood, which may not align perfectly with feeling nervous. However, given the potential for anxiety in the described behavior, we can assign a moderate score to this item.
   - Unit: null

2. Parameter: control_worrying
   - Value: The patient is described as "脑子里面想很多事情停不下来" (cannot stop thinking about many things), "不停找人倾诉工作的不公平及生活琐事" (constantly seeking someone to talk about unfairness at work and trivial matters in life), and "昨日患者称自己被人控制住了" (yesterday, claimed to be controlled by someone). These statements suggest an inability to control thoughts and persistent worrying, which align with this parameter.
   - Unit: null

3. Parameter: worry_too_much
   - Value: The individual states "说话滔滔不绝" (talking endlessly), "有人要害自己" (feeling someone wants to harm them), and "拿利器威胁要伤害自己" (threatening self-harm with a sharp object). These behaviors indicate excessive worry and paranoia, which relate to worrying too much about different things.
   - Unit: null

4. Parameter: trouble_relaxing
   - Value: The patient's description includes "难于放松" (difficult to relax), which directly corresponds to having trouble relaxing.
   - Unit: null

5. Parameter: restlessness
   - Value: The patient description does not explicitly mention restlessness. However, considering the overall behavior and symptoms described, there appears to be a level of agitation that could be interpreted as restlessness.
   - Unit: null

6. Parameter: irritability
   - Value: The patient is described as "有打骂丈夫的行为" (having behavior of hitting/scolding husband) and "对丈夫行为冲动" (impulsiveness towards husband). These actions suggest irritability and easily being annoyed, which fits this parameter.
   - Unit: null

7. Parameter: fear_of_awful_events
   - Value: The patient states "有人要害自己" (feeling someone wants to harm them) and "拿利器威胁要伤害自己" (threatening self-harm with a sharp object). These statements point to a fear of awful events, specifically harm towards oneself.
   - Unit: null
