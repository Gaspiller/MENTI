    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表被用于评估肝硬化患者肝功能疾病严重程度和肝移植候选资格？}}
Task Scenario: {{根据提供的病历资料显示，该患者主要病情为乙型肝炎后肝硬化及晚期HCC（肝细胞癌）。血液检查显示白蛋白（ALB）水平较低，存在缺铁性贫血病史，腹水征阳性，以及肝功能指标如天门冬氨酸氨基转移酶（AST）、丙氨酸氨基转移酶（ALT）、碱性磷酸酶（ALP）和γ-谷氨酰转肽酶（GGT）的异常升高等，均反映了患者肝功能受损。

此外，彩色超声及增强CT显示肝脏结构异常，出现了肝硬化、脾大、腹水，门脉栓子形成，肿瘤标志物如AFP和PIVKAⅡ的升高提示HCC的存在。患者出现上消化道大出血，复查CT显示胸腔积液及双肺下叶膨胀不全等表现，提示可能存在门静脉高压导致的并发症。

综合分析，该患者的乙型肝炎后肝硬化主要表现为肝功能减退、门脉高压、腹水等并发症，同时合并HCC的情况使得肝损伤更加复杂。针对这些表现，治疗方案应包括止血、输血、维持器官功能、抑制肿瘤生长等综合治疗措施。}}
