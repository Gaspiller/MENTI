You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估非心脏手术患者术后心脏并发症的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病历信息，患者主要的问题是右腹股沟直疝，即右侧腹股沟内出现异常强回声团块，考虑为腹股沟疝。这可能导致部分肠管或其他腹部组织突出至腹股沟区域，导致症状如局部坠胀酸痛。经过全麻下行的腹腔镜下右腹股沟疝无张力修补术后，患者病情好转。

此外，患者还出现先天性右室发育异常和不完全性右束支传导阻滞。右室发育异常可能对心脏功能和血液循环产生影响。而不完全性右束支传导阻滞可能影响心脏的传导功能，可能会出现心脏节律不齐等问题。心电图显示出右束支传导阻滞的迹象。

综合来看，患者的主要问题与腹部疝气有关，同时存在心脏方面的问题，可能会影响心脏的正常功能。治疗腹股沟直疝的同时，也需要重点关注心脏功能的监测和管理。
