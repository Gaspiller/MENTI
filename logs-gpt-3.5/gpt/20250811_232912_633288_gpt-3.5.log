[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估支气管肺炎患者的严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和临床表现，可以看出患儿患有支气管肺炎和腺病毒感染，同时出现胃肠功能紊乱的症状。支气管肺炎表现为发热、咳嗽、肺部湿啰音等症状，而腺病毒感染可能导致全身症状，如发热和乏力。胃肠功能紊乱则表现为排稀便、腹部膨隆等症状。

综合分析支气管肺炎和腺病毒感染的症状，可以推测患儿呼吸道和免疫系统可能存在一定的功能障碍，表现为呼吸困难、易感染等。而胃肠功能紊乱可能暗示着消化系统的功能异常，可能导致吸收和排出物质的问题。治疗方案中包括抗感染治疗和对症治疗，有助于改善患儿的症状和病情好转。
