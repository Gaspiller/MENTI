You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}
Step By Step Analysis:
{{Here is your step-by-step analysis.}}
Parameters List:
```json
{
    "weight": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "kg"},
    "height": {"Value": 175, "Unit": "cm"}
}
```

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.
    
    Parameters:
    - hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
    - bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

    Returns:
    - int: Glasgow-Blatchford Score, ranging from 0 to 23.

    This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. **hemoglobin**: Based on the Reference Text, the patient's hemoglobin level is 63g/L. Fill in the value as 63 and the unit as "g/L".

2. **bun**: The blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level of the patient is given as 5.6mmol/L in the Reference Text. Fill in the value as 5.6 and the unit as "mmol/L".

3. **systolic_bp**: The initial systolic blood pressure of the patient is reported as 112/67mmHg in the Reference Text. Take the systolic value, which is 112, and use "mmHg" as the unit.

4. **sex**: The sex of the patient is male, so fill in the value as 1.

5. **heart_rate**: There is no direct information provided about the heart rate in the Reference Text. However, the patient's condition mentions chest discomfort, sweating, nausea, dizziness, and a previous history of coronary artery disease. Given these symptoms, we can assume that the heart rate might be elevated (≥100 per minute). Fill in the value as 1.

6. **melena**: The presence of black stools indicates gastrointestinal bleeding, which is associated with melena. Fill in the value as 1.

7. **syncope**: The recent syncope is mentioned as absent in the text. Fill in the value as 0.

8. **hepatic_disease**: There is no indication of hepatic disease in the patient's history in the Reference Text. Fill in the value as 0.

9. **cardiac_failure**: The patient's medical history includes coronary artery disease, which is a form of heart disease. Fill in the value as 2 since the patient has heart disease.
