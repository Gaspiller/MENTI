[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者在高风险手术前的心脏风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和辅助检查结果显示，患者出现少量暗红色流血并显示前置胎盘，推测患者可能存在前置胎盘伴出血，可能伴随有子宫出血和胎盘功能障碍。这可能导致胎儿供氧不足，增加孕妇产生贫血和可能的出血风险。建议密切关注孕妇和胎儿的情况，并根据医生建议进行进一步的治疗和管理。
