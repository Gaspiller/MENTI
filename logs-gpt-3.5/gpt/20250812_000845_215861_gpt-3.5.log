You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. "elevated_risk_surgery":
    - Reference Text: The patient is scheduled for labor induction.
    - Inference: Since the patient is not undergoing intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular surgery, the value for this parameter is False.
    - Output: False

2. "history_of_ischemic_heart_disease":
    - Reference Text: The patient has no history of ischemic heart disease or symptoms related to it.
    - Inference: Based on the absence of history or symptoms related to ischemic heart disease, the value for this parameter is False.
    - Output: False

3. "history_of_congestive_heart_failure":
    - Reference Text: The patient has no signs or symptoms of congestive heart failure.
    - Inference: Since there are no signs of congestive heart failure in the patient, the value for this parameter is False.
    - Output: False

4. "history_of_cerebrovascular_disease":
    - Reference Text: The patient has no history of cerebrovascular disease.
    - Inference: Considering the absence of any history of cerebrovascular disease, the value for this parameter is False.
    - Output: False

5. "preop_treatment_with_insulin":
    - Reference Text: There is no indication of the patient receiving pre-operative treatment with insulin.
    - Inference: As there is no mention of pre-operative insulin treatment for the patient, the value for this parameter is False.
    - Output: False

6. "preop_creatinine_above_threshold":
    - Reference Text: The patient's preoperative creatinine levels are normal.
    - Inference: Given that the patient's preoperative creatinine levels are within the normal range, the value for this parameter is False.
    - Output: False
