Detailed information of each tool: {{PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9): Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.


GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7): Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
    based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
    2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

    This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
    including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
    It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
    to assess and monitor treatment responses.

    Parameters:
    - nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
    - control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
    - worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
    - trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
    - restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
    - irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
    - fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

    Returns:
    int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

    Usage Example:
    gad_7_score = calculate_gad_7(3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
    print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score


Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism: Calculates the Wells' Criteria for Pulmonary Embolism (PE).
    
    This function estimates the pre-test probability of pulmonary embolism based on certain clinical criteria.
    It helps in stratifying patients into different risk categories which then guides further diagnostic testing like d-dimer or CT angiogram.
    
    Parameters:
    dvt_symptoms (bool): True if there are clinical signs and symptoms of deep vein thrombosis (DVT), else False.
    pe_diagnosis (bool): True if pulmonary embolism is the #1 diagnosis or equally likely, else False.

    float: The total score based on Wells' Criteria, which can be used to estimate the risk of pulmonary embolism.
    
    Application:
    This score should be used in conjunction with clinical judgment in patients who have a suspicion of pulmonary embolism.
    It is validated for both inpatient and emergency department settings.
    Not suitable for all patients with chest pain or shortness of breath without a clinical suspicion of PE.


STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Calculate the STOP-BANG Score for screening Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

    This score is useful for patients undergoing preoperative evaluation but should not be used if a patient
    has already been diagnosed with OSA or uses CPAP at night. It helps in identifying patients who might have
    OSA and are at increased risk of perioperative cardiopulmonary complications, as well as other morbidity
    associated with OSA like daytime sleepiness and cardiopulmonary conditions.

Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.

    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.
 

Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) Calculator: Calculate the Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) per day based on the opioid dosage,
    number of doses per day, and the drug used. This function can handle multiple drugs

    Parameters:
    - dosages (list of float): List of dosages for each drug in the units appropriate for the drug
      (mcg/hr for fentanyl patches, mcg for fentanyl buccal/sublingual tablets, and mg for all other opioids).
    - doses_per_day (list of int): List of doses per day for each corresponding drug.
    - drugs (list of int): List of indexes representing drugs where each index corresponds to:
      0: Codeine, 1: Fentanyl buccal or sublingual, 2: Fentanyl patch, 3: Hydrocodone,

    Note:
    - The conversion factors are based on standard estimates and may not account for individual differences.
    - Buprenorphine is not included in the calculations as per its unique pharmacological profile.

PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism: Calculate the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) to determine if further testing for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
    is unnecessary in patients considered low-risk.

    The PERC rule helps avoid unnecessary PE testing in low-risk patients. It requires that all criteria must be negative
    (i.e., all parameters must receive a 'no' to rule out PE without further testing).

    - prior_pe_or_dvt (bool): Whether the patient has a history of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) or Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). False for no, True for yes.
    - hormone_use (bool): Whether the patient is using hormones such as oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, or estrogenic hormones in male or female patients. False for no, True for yes.

    Returns:
    - result (bool): True if the patient can be ruled out for PE without further testing (all criteria negative), False otherwise.


Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality: Calculate the Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality.

    The Child-Pugh Score helps estimate the prognosis for a patient with cirrhosis.
    Note that newer scores like the MELD and MELD-Na are generally preferred for their
    increased accuracy in prognosis.

    Parameters:
    - bilirubin (float): Total bilirubin level in mg/dL.
    - albumin (float): Albumin level in g/dL.
    - inr (float): International Normalized Ratio.
    - ascites (str): Describes the presence of ascites ('Absent', 'Slight', 'Moderate').
    - encephalopathy (int): Grade of hepatic encephalopathy (0 for none, 1-2 for Grade 1-2, 3-4 for Grade 3-4).

    Returns:
