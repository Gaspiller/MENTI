[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估该患者肺炎的严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病例，患者的临床诊断为支气管炎和中性粒细胞减少症。在辅助检查中，患者的中性粒细胞数绝对值低于正常范围，降钙素原测定结果也显示偏低。这表明患者存在中性粒细胞减少症，可能导致免疫功能下降和抵抗力降低，容易出现感染等症状。支气管炎引起的呼吸道疾病也可能加重患者症状。需要进一步关注患者的免疫系统功能和呼吸道情况，以便针对病因进行治疗。
