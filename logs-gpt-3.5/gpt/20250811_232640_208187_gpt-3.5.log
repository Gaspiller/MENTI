You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'APACHE II Score', 'MDRD GFR Equation', 'HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance)', 'PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'Maintenance Fluids Calculations', 'PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.


Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score: "Calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score which is used to assess the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.

MDRD GFR Equation: Calculate the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).
    This function estimates kidney function in patients with stable chronic kidney disease.
    It should not be used to assess acute renal failure or when GFR is >60 ml/min/m2 as it underestimates GFR.

    Parameters:

    The formula used:
    GFR = 175 × Serum Cr^{-1.154} × age^{-0.203} × 1.212 (if patient is black) × 0.742 (if female)


HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance): Calculate the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).

    The HOMA-IR is a clinical tool used to estimate insulin resistance (IR), which can be
    indicative of potential glucose intolerance and diabetes. It is particularly useful
    in scenarios where more invasive and time-consuming methods like the clamp measurement
    (considered the gold standard for measuring IR) are not feasible. Although the HOMA-IR
    provides a reasonable correlation with clamp measurements, it is less accurate on an
    individual basis, which suggests a need for caution in its clinical application and
    interpretation.

    Parameters:
    - fasting_insulin (float): The fasting insulin level in uIU/mL.
    - fasting_glucose (float): The fasting glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR score).

    Formula:
    HOMA-IR score = (fasting insulin * fasting glucose) / 405

PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP: Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
    It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk: Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with

    >>> calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(75, 'female', True, True, True, True, True)
    9

        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.

Maintenance Fluids Calculations: Calculate the Maintenance Fluids rate using the "4-2-1" Rule.
    
    This function determines the intravenous (IV) fluid rate for patients who are not taking oral fluids,
    addressing needs such as vomiting, NPO status, dehydration, insensible losses, or third spacing. It uses
    a weight-based dosing method to ensure appropriate fluid volume according to patient's weight.
    
    Parameters:
    - weight (float): The weight of the patient in kilograms.
    
    Returns:
    - float: The calculated IV fluid rate in mL per hour.
    
    Usage:
    - This calculation is crucial in medical settings where accurate fluid replacement is necessary,
      particularly in settings where patients cannot intake fluids orally.
    
    Example:
    - calculate_maintenance_fluids(25)  # Calculates fluid rate for a 25 kg patient.

PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9): Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表被用于评估患者的肾小球滤过率？}}
Task Scenario: {{分析:
根据患者的主诉和临床表现，患者出现双下肢水肿、乏力、清晨双眼睑轻度浮肿、心慌、喘气等症状，伴随着高血压、血糖升高、肌酐和尿酸升高等实验室检查结果，以及肾功能不全的诊断，可以推断患者患有慢性肾衰竭代偿期。肾脏是人体的重要器官，可以调节体内水盐平衡、清除代谢废物等，当肾功能受损时会导致水电解质紊乱、水肿、乏力等症状的出现。患者还存在高血压、血糖升高等其他慢性疾病，这些疾病可能会加重肾脏负担，进一步影响肾功能的代偿能力。因此，肾功能的不全可能导致水肿、体力下降等症状的出现。治疗后病情好转，可能是针对肾功能不全进行了相应的治疗和管理。}}
