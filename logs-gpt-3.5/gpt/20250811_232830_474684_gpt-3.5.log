You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. Your task is to transform the user's input search query into several similar queries, thereby helping the user to retrieve more useful information.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must be closely related to the input search query.
2. The generated queries must not alter the user's original intent.
3. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
4. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
5. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

Begin!

doctor input search query: The spo2 value and unit are missing. Both the value and unit must be provided.

[output]  ```json
[
    "What is the importance of providing the value and unit for spo2 in medical reports?",
    "How does the absence of spo2 value and unit affect diagnosis and treatment?",
    "Explaining the significance of including spo2 value and unit in medical records"
]
```
