You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估ICU患者的严重疾病风险和死亡率？

Patient Case Analysis:

Based on the provided patient's case, the main abnormal parts are:
1. Sudden onset of altered mental status and restlessness.
2. Rapid breathing and vomiting with gastric contents.
3. Diagnosis of septic shock, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (acute liver and kidney dysfunction, coagulation abnormalities).

From the symptoms described, the patient may be experiencing impaired cognitive function, respiratory distress, gastrointestinal issues, and organ failure. The abnormal laboratory results indicate elevated inflammatory markers (CRP), impaired liver function (elevated transaminases), renal dysfunction (elevated creatinine), and coagulation abnormalities (low platelet count).

The low blood pressure, cold extremities, and weak arterial pulse suggest circulatory shock. The presence of sepsis is supported by the elevated white blood cell count and the presence of urinary protein and blood. The abnormal blood gas values and A-a gradient suggest respiratory distress and impaired oxygen exchange.

In summary, the patient is likely experiencing severe sepsis leading to septic shock and multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, affecting the liver, kidneys, coagulation system, and possibly respiratory function. Immediate intensive care and supportive therapy are essential to manage these critical conditions.
