[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估HBV患者的肝脏纤维化程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和辅助检查结果，可以推断患者可能出现了空腔脏器穿孔，导致腹部疼痛和压痛，肝肾功能受损的情况，可能存在腹部感染和炎症反应，造成C-反应蛋白升高。此外，低血压和电解质异常（如钠、钾、镁等）也可能影响了患者的体液平衡和神经肌肉功能。建议尽快进行进一步检查和治疗以确定诊断，并及时纠正电解质紊乱和处理腹部病变，以避免进一步严重后果。
