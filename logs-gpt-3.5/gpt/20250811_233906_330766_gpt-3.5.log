Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia: Calculate the corrected calcium level in patients with suspected hypocalcemia
    who have low albumin levels. Hypocalcemia might not be apparent if serum albumin is low,
    thus this formula adjusts the calcium level based on albumin discrepancy.

    patient_albumin (float): The patient's measured albumin level in g/dL.

    8.84
 

STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Calculate the STOP-BANG Score for screening Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

    This score is useful for patients undergoing preoperative evaluation but should not be used if a patient
    has already been diagnosed with OSA or uses CPAP at night. It helps in identifying patients who might have
    OSA and are at increased risk of perioperative cardiopulmonary complications, as well as other morbidity
    associated with OSA like daytime sleepiness and cardiopulmonary conditions.

    Parameters:
    - snore_loudly (bool): True if the patient snores loudly (louder than talking or loud enough to be heard through closed doors), False otherwise.
    - feel_tired_daytime (bool): True if the patient often feels tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime, False otherwise.
    - observed_apnea (bool): True if anyone has observed the patient stop breathing during sleep, False otherwise.
    - high_blood_pressure (bool): True if the patient has or is being treated for high blood pressure, False otherwise.
    - bmi (float): Body Mass Index of the patient.
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - neck_circumference (float): Neck circumference of the patient in centimeters.
    - gender (str): Gender of the patient. Expected values: 'Female' or 'Male'.

    Returns:

         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:

    The Child-Pugh Score helps estimate the prognosis for a patient with cirrhosis.
    Note that newer scores like the MELD and MELD-Na are generally preferred for their
    increased accuracy in prognosis.

Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.

        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333

ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications: Calculate the ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications.
    This score helps predict the risk of pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery under general, neuraxial, or regional anesthesia.

HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance): Calculate the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).

    The HOMA-IR is a clinical tool used to estimate insulin resistance (IR), which can be
    indicative of potential glucose intolerance and diabetes. It is particularly useful
    in scenarios where more invasive and time-consuming methods like the clamp measurement
    (considered the gold standard for measuring IR) are not feasible. Although the HOMA-IR
    provides a reasonable correlation with clamp measurements, it is less accurate on an
    individual basis, which suggests a need for caution in its clinical application and
    interpretation.

    Parameters:
    - fasting_insulin (float): The fasting insulin level in uIU/mL.
    - fasting_glucose (float): The fasting glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR score).

    Formula:
    HOMA-IR score = (fasting insulin * fasting glucose) / 405
