[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估患者的肾小球滤过率？

Patient Case Analysis:

分析:
根据患者的主诉和临床表现，患者出现双下肢水肿、乏力、清晨双眼睑轻度浮肿、心慌、喘气等症状，伴随着高血压、血糖升高、肌酐和尿酸升高等实验室检查结果，以及肾功能不全的诊断，可以推断患者患有慢性肾衰竭代偿期。肾脏是人体的重要器官，可以调节体内水盐平衡、清除代谢废物等，当肾功能受损时会导致水电解质紊乱、水肿、乏力等症状的出现。患者还存在高血压、血糖升高等其他慢性疾病，这些疾病可能会加重肾脏负担，进一步影响肾功能的代偿能力。因此，肾功能的不全可能导致水肿、体力下降等症状的出现。治疗后病情好转，可能是针对肾功能不全进行了相应的治疗和管理。
