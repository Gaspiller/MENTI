[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

Patient Case Analysis:

Based on the provided patient's case, the main abnormality is the patient's state of coma and inability to respond. The patient was found unconscious with no response to stimuli, along with vomiting. This could suggest impairment in the patient's central nervous system, possibly involving the brainstem or higher cognitive functions. The normal vital signs and lack of specific focal neurological deficits may indicate a diffuse brain dysfunction rather than a localized lesion. Further evaluation and neuroimaging studies may be needed to determine the exact cause of the coma.

    "Which scale is commonly used to assess the level of consciousness and degree of coma in patients?",
    "What assessment tool is typically employed to evaluate a patient's awareness level and depth of unconsciousness?",
    "What instrument is utilized to gauge the consciousness status and degree of coma in patients?"
