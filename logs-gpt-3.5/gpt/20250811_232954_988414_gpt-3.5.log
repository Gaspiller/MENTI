         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.

User Demand: {{哪个评估量表被用于评估患者支气管炎肺炎的严重程度？}}
Task Scenario: {{Based on the provided patient's case, the main abnormal parts include:
1. Productive cough with yellow sputum for 4 days, along with fever and lung inflammation observed in the chest CT scan.
