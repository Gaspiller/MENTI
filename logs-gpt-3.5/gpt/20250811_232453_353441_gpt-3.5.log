[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的肾小球滤过率？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病例分析，患者存在右肾萎缩、左侧输尿管末端结石、左肾积水、肾周渗出等情况，这表明患者泌尿系统出现了严重问题，可能导致尿液正常排出的功能受损。此外，患者还出现了慢性肾衰竭急性加重的情况，提示肾功能受损且急性加重。结合房颤、肝脏多发占位性病变、心功能减低等情况，可能导致对心衰、循环系统等方面功能的影响，严重威胁患者的生命健康。治疗方案中的输尿管镜下钬激光碎石术的麻醉需要谨慎考虑，以免对患者身体其他系统造成更多影响。
