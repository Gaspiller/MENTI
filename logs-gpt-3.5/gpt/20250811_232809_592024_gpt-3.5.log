[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估肺炎患者的严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病史和辅助检查结果，患者主要出现咳嗽、咳痰、右肺下叶炎性改变、右侧胸膜肥厚并胸腔及叶间积液，最可能诊断为肺部感染。这种感染可能导致呼吸系统功能受损，如肺功能受限，呼吸困难等。同时，肺部感染也有可能引起全身症状，如发热、心率增快等。需要进一步治疗以缓解症状并恢复肺部功能。
