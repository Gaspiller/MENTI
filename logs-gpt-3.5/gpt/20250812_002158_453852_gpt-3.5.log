[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

Patient Case Analysis:

Analyzing the provided patient's case, the main abnormal parts include self-ingestion of a large amount of rodenticide, self-inflicted stab wounds to the chest and abdomen resulting in liver contusion, abdominal fluid accumulation, and hemorrhagic anemia. These factors indicate impairment in the liver function due to the potential liver tear injury, as evidenced by the presence of liver contusion and fluid accumulation around the liver. Additionally, the hemorrhagic anemia suggests impaired blood clotting and reduced red blood cell count. The treatment with blood purification injections also supports the diagnosis of liver injury and associated complications.

[
    "What scale is used to assess cardiac risk in patients before surgery with liver injury and impaired blood clotting?",
    "Which assessment tool is recommended for evaluating heart risks in patients prior to surgery with liver impairment?",
    "What test is suitable for evaluating the cardiac risk of patients before surgery with liver damage and hemorrhagic anemia?"
]
