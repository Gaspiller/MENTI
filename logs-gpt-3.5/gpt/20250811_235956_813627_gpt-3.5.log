You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator', 'CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity', 'Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS)', 'Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk', 'PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator: Calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

    This function uses a standard method recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),
    which considers the first trimester ultrasound measurements to be the most accurate method to establish gestational age.

    Parameters:
    - cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
                           If cycle_length is more than 28, the difference is added to the 40-week period.
    - last_menstrual_period (str): The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

    Returns:
    - str: The estimated due date in the format 'Day, Month DD, YYYY'.

    Usage:
    The function is intended for use by healthcare providers to estimate due dates for pregnant patients,
    which can help in managing pregnancy timelines effectively and in planning medical care accordingly.

    Example:
    'Monday, Oct 16, 2023'


CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity: 
    Calculate the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.

    The CURB-65 calculator can be used in the emergency department setting to risk stratify a patient’s community acquired pneumonia.
    It includes points for confusion, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age.
    
    Parameters:
    confusion (int): Confusion status, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes.
    bun (int): Blood urea nitrogen status, where 0 = BUN ≤ 19 mg/dL (≤ 7 mmol/L urea) and 1 = BUN > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L urea).
    respiratory_rate (int): Respiratory rate status, where 0 = < 30 breaths/min and 1 = ≥ 30 breaths/min.
    blood_pressure (int): Blood pressure status, where 0 = Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg, and 1 = Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg.
    age (int): Age status, where 0 = < 65 years and 1 = ≥ 65 years.

    Returns:
    int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

    Usage:
    This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.
    
    Example:
    >>> curb_65_score(1, 1, 1, 0, 1)
    4
   

Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS): Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.

PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism: Calculate the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) to determine if further testing for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
    is unnecessary in patients considered low-risk.

    The PERC rule helps avoid unnecessary PE testing in low-risk patients. It requires that all criteria must be negative
    (i.e., all parameters must receive a 'no' to rule out PE without further testing).

CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk: Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:

         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表用于计算患者预产期？}}
Task Scenario: {{Analysis:

1. The patient is diagnosed with gestational diabetes, which is a type of diabetes that occurs during pregnancy and can lead to high blood sugar levels. This condition can impair glucose regulation and metabolism in the body, affecting both the mother and the developing fetus.

2. The patient also has fungal vaginitis, which can indicate an imbalance in the vaginal microbiome and may lead to symptoms such as abnormal vaginal discharge and itching. This condition can impair the normal functioning of the vaginal environment.

3. The presence of oligohydramnios, which is a condition characterized by reduced amniotic fluid levels in the uterus, can have implications for fetal development and can affect the normal cushioning and protection provided by the amniotic fluid.

Based on the provided patient's case, the impaired bodily functions may include glucose regulation and metabolism, vaginal flora balance, and amniotic fluid production. These conditions require proper management and treatment to ensure the well-being of both the mother and the fetus.}}
