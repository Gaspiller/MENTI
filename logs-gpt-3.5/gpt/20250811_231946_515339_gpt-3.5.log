You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估肝硬化患者的肝功能和疾病严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:

1. Liver cirrhosis in the decompensated phase: The patient's clinical diagnosis of liver cirrhosis in the decompensated phase is supported by the physical examination findings of hepatomegaly, jaundice, and abnormal liver function tests (elevated AST, GGT, bilirubin levels).
Impaired bodily functions: Impaired liver function, leading to jaundice, ascites, and potential coagulopathy.

2. Hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease): The patient's clinical diagnosis of hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease) is supported by the history of enlarged thyroid, symptoms of weight loss, palpitations, and tremors, as well as the laboratory results showing significantly elevated levels of thyroid hormones (TSH suppressed, elevated FT3, FT4 levels) and positive anti-thyroid antibodies.
Impaired bodily functions: Thyrotoxicosis leading to symptoms such as tachycardia, weight loss, and possible exacerbation of heart failure.

3. Decompensated heart failure (NYHA class IV), heart disease: The patient's clinical diagnosis of decompensated heart failure with NYHA class IV symptoms is supported by symptoms of dyspnea, orthopnea, and pedal edema, as well as physical examination findings of cardiomegaly and bilateral pulmonary congestion.
Impaired bodily functions: Impaired cardiac function leading to symptoms of congestive heart failure and potential complications such as pulmonary edema.

In conclusion, the patient's case presents with multiple abnormalities including liver cirrhosis, hyperthyroidism, and decompensated heart failure, all of which can lead to significant impairment in liver function, thyroid function, and cardiac function, respectively. Treatment with medications aimed at liver protection, anti-hyperthyroidism, and heart rhythm management has shown improvement in the patient's condition.
