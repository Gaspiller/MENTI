[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估手术患者的静脉血栓栓塞症（VTE）风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病案信息，患者出现了头痛、左侧肢体麻木、左侧面部及左侧躯干麻木、左侧肢体无力等症状。经过检查发现患者患有颅内静脉窦非化脓性血栓形成。这可能导致脑部供血不足，出现头痛及肢体感觉、运动功能受损等问题。治疗方案包括营养神经、脱水降颅内压力等措施，病情逐渐好转。因此，患者颅内静脉血栓可能导致脑部功能方面的问题，可能会影响感觉、运动功能等方面的表现。
