You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}
Step By Step Analysis:
{{Here is your step-by-step analysis.}}
Parameters List:
```json
{
    "weight": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "kg"},
    "height": {"Value": 175, "Unit": "cm"}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 Âµmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.

Reference Text:
{{The following parameters need to be updated to adhere to the requirements in the Function Docstring: elevated_risk_surgery, history_of_ischemic_heart_disease, history_of_congestive_heart_failure, history_of_cerebrovascular_disease, preop_treatment_with_insulin, preop_creatinine_above_threshold.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Parameter: elevated_risk_surgery
- From the Reference Text: No specific information is provided about whether the surgery is "intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular."
- Inference: Since there is no clear indication in the reference text, we cannot determine the value for this parameter. We will randomly assign a value.
- Value: True (assuming the surgery falls under one of the mentioned categories)
- Unit: null (boolean parameter)

2. Parameter: history_of_ischemic_heart_disease
- From the Reference Text: No direct mention of a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
- Inference: Since none of the specific risk factors are mentioned, we infer that none of them are present.
- Value: False
- Unit: null (boolean parameter)

3. Parameter: history_of_congestive_heart_failure
- From the Reference Text: No signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution are mentioned.
- Inference: Based on the absence of these signs in the reference text, we infer that there is no history of congestive heart failure.
- Value: False
- Unit: null (boolean parameter)

4. Parameter: history_of_cerebrovascular_disease
- From the Reference Text: No explicit mention of a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
- Inference: Since there is no reference to cerebrovascular events, we infer that there is no history of cerebrovascular disease.
- Value: False
- Unit: null (boolean parameter)

5. Parameter: preop_treatment_with_insulin
- From the Reference Text: No information provided regarding pre-operative treatment with insulin.
- Inference: Due to the lack of details, we cannot determine if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively. We will randomly assign a value.
- Value: True (randomly assigned)
- Unit: null (boolean parameter)

6. Parameter: preop_creatinine_above_threshold
- From the Reference Text: No specific value is given for pre-operative creatinine levels.
- Inference: Since there is no mention of the creatinine levels being above the threshold, we assume that they are not elevated.
- Value: False
- Unit: null (boolean parameter)
