[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估上消化道出血患者的出血风险和适合门诊治疗的可能性？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和临床表现，可以初步推断患者的主要问题是急性上消化道出血导致的失血性休克和重度贫血。血常规和血红蛋白水平的显著降低以及血气分析中血红蛋白和血乳酸的异常值均支持这一推断。此外，患者的呕血症状和消化道出血病史也进一步证实了这一点。

在这种情况下，失血性休克可能导致机体循环功能受损，进而影响全身组织器官的供氧和代谢功能。同时，重度贫血会影响氧气的输送和细胞的代谢活动。需立即采取止血和输血等治疗措施，并密切监测患者的病情变化和器官功能，以防止进一步的损害。
