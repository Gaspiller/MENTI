You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}
Step By Step Analysis:
{{Here is your step-by-step analysis.}}
Parameters List:
```json
{
    "weight": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "kg"},
    "height": {"Value": 175, "Unit": "cm"}
}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the APACHE II Score for a patient in the ICU, to assess severity and predict mortality.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - temperature (float): Rectal temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - mean_arterial_pressure (int): Mean arterial pressure in mm Hg.
    - heart_rate (int): Heart rate in beats per minute.
    - respiratory_rate (int): Respiratory rate in breaths per minute.
    - sodium (float): Serum sodium in mmol/L.
    - potassium (float): Serum potassium in mmol/L.
    - creatinine (float): Serum creatinine in mg/100 mL.
    - hematocrit (float): Hematocrit percentage.
    - white_blood_cell_count (float): White blood cell count per cubic millimeter.
    - gcs (int): Glasgow Coma Scale score, ranging from 3 (most impaired) to 15 (fully awake).
    - ph (float): Arterial pH.
    - history_of_severe_organ_insufficiency (int): Indicates the patient's history status, with 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes, and elective postoperative patient', and 2 for 'Yes, and nonoperative or emergency postoperative patient'.
    - acute_renal_failure (int): Indicates if the patient has acute renal failure, with 0 for 'No' and 1 for 'Yes'.
    - fio2 (int): Fraction of inspired oxygen, 0 for '<50%' and 1 for '≥50%'.
    - pao2 (float, optional): Partial pressure of arterial oxygen, required if FiO2 < 50%.
    - a_a_gradient (float, optional): Alveolar-arterial gradient, required if FiO2 ≥ 50%.

    Returns:
    - int: The computed APACHE II score.
}}
Reference Text:
{{The history_of_severe_organ_insufficiency value needs to be provided, and it should be an integer indicating the patient's history status as described in the Function Docstring.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  In the Reference Text, the history_of_severe_organ_insufficiency value needs to be provided as an integer, indicating the patient's history status. We need to extract this value based on the Function Docstring.
