You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the Wells' Criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).

    This scale helps clinicians in outpatient and emergency settings to stratify patients' risk of DVT. A score below 2, coupled with a negative d-dimer test, allows clinicians to rule out DVT without the need for ultrasound imaging. This method balances the need for accurate diagnosis with the resource and time costs associated with more invasive tests.

    Parameters:
    active_cancer (bool): True if the patient has active cancer (treatment within last 6 months).
    bedridden_recently (bool): True if the patient was bedridden for more than 3 days recently or had major surgery within the last 12 weeks.
    calf_swelling (bool): True if the patient's calf swelling exceeds 3 cm compared to the other leg.
    collateral_veins (bool): True if collateral non-varicose superficial veins are present.
    entire_leg_swollen (bool): True if the entire leg is swollen.
    localized_tenderness (bool): True if there is localized tenderness along the deep venous system.
    pitting_edema (bool): True if there is pitting edema confined to the symptomatic leg.
    recent_immobilization (bool): True if the patient had paralysis, paresis, or recent plaster immobilization of the lower extremities.
    previous_dvt (bool): True if the patient has a history of documented DVT.
    alternative_diagnosis (bool): True if an alternative diagnosis is as likely or more likely than DVT.

    Returns:
    int: Wells' score for DVT, where higher values indicate a higher probability of DVT.

    Usage:
    score = calculate_wells_criteria_dvt(True, False, True, True, False, True, True, False, True, False)}}

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. active_cancer:
Based on the reference text, there is no mention of the patient having active cancer within the last 6 months. Therefore, we can infer that active_cancer is False.

2. bedridden_recently:
The reference text does not provide clear information about the patient being bedridden for more than 3 days recently or having major surgery within the last 12 weeks. Given that the patient is an outpatient and the treatment involved intravenous injections and medications, we can assume that the patient was not bedridden recently. Therefore, bedridden_recently is False.

3. calf_swelling:
There is no mention of calf swelling exceeding 3 cm in the reference text. Since no specific swelling of the calf is described, we can assume that calf_swelling is False.

4. collateral_veins:
The presence of collateral non-varicose superficial veins is not mentioned in the reference text. Since no information is provided to suggest the presence of collateral veins, we can assume that collateral_veins is False.

5. entire_leg_swollen:
The reference text does not state that the entire leg is swollen. Since there is no mention of complete leg swelling in the text, we can assume that entire_leg_swollen is False.

6. localized_tenderness:
There is no direct mention of localized tenderness along the deep venous system in the reference text. Given the patient's symptoms of headache and numbness in the left limbs, we can assume that localized_tenderness is False.

7. pitting_edema:
The presence of pitting edema confined to the symptomatic leg is not mentioned in the reference text. Since there is no description of pitting edema, we can assume that pitting_edema is False.

8. recent_immobilization:
The reference text does not indicate recent paralysis, paresis, or plaster immobilization of the lower extremities. Based on the lack of mention of recent immobilization, we can infer that recent_immobilization is False.

9. previous_dvt:
The patient's history of documented DVT is not mentioned in the reference text. Since no previous DVT is described, we can assume that previous_dvt is False.

10. alternative_diagnosis:
There is no direct indication of another diagnosis being as likely or more likely than DVT in the reference text. Since alternative diagnoses are not mentioned, we can assume that alternative_diagnosis is False.
