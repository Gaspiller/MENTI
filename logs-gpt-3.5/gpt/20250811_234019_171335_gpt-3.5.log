Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation): 
    Calculate the Creatinine Clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation.

    This function estimates kidney function, useful for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) staging
    and adjusting or discontinuing medications based on kidney function. It incorporates
    the patient's age, weight, sex, and serum creatinine levels to calculate the clearance rate.
    This is particularly relevant when considering medication dosages for patients with reduced
    kidney function, despite potential overestimations in GFR with newer creatinine assays.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Should be a positive integer.
    - weight (float): The weight of the patient in kilograms. Should be a positive decimal.
    - creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level in mg/dL. Should be a positive decimal.
    - sex (str): The sex of the patient. Acceptable values are 'male' or 'female'.
                 This affects the calculation as there is a different multiplier for females.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated creatinine clearance in mL/min.
    
    Example:
    >>> calculate_creatinine_clearance(50, 70, 1.2, 'female')
    49.30555555555556
  

CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.


Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk: Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
 

Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity: Calculate the Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity using the Smithline-Gardner Formula.

    This function calculates the serum osmolality/osmolarity based on the concentrations of sodium, glucose,
    and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the blood. Serum osmolality is a measure of the solute concentration in the blood,
    and it can be used to assess the body's fluid and electrolyte balance. An osmolar gap (difference between measured
    and expected osmolality) greater than 10 can indicate the presence of certain toxic alcohols, mannitol, or propylene glycol.

    Note: At extreme levels of serum glucose, such as in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), the osmolar gap may be skewed,
    and clinical judgment should be used.

    Parameters:
    serum_na (float): Serum sodium concentration in mmol/L. Typical reference range is 135-145 mmol/L.
    serum_glucose (float): Serum glucose concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 70-100 mg/dL.
    serum_bun (float): Blood urea nitrogen concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 7-20 mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: Calculated serum osmolality in mOsm/kg.

    Formula:
    Serum Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 2 * (serum_na) + (serum_glucose / 18) + (serum_bun / 2.8)


CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk: Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
    - history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.
