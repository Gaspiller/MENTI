You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于预测患者在接受冠状动脉造影术+左心导管术后6周内发生重大心脏不良事件的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:
1. The patient has a history of X syndrome, acute bronchitis, peptic ulcer, post-traumatic brain sequelae, and chronic otitis media. These conditions suggest a complex medical history with possible underlying systemic issues.
2. The patient presented with symptoms of chest tightness, shortness of breath, and headache, which led to a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. This indicates a potential cardiovascular issue, possibly related to coronary artery disease or myocardial ischemia.
3. The patient's past medical history includes hypertension, traumatic brain injury, and nerve damage in the left arm, indicating a history of vascular and neurological issues.
4. The patient underwent coronary angiography and left heart catheterization, which resulted in disease improvement. This suggests that the cardiovascular system was affected and required intervention to address the issue.

Speculated Impairments:
1. Impaired cardiovascular function, possibly due to coronary artery disease or myocardial ischemia.
2. Possible neurological impairments related to the past traumatic brain injury and nerve damage in the left arm.
3. Long-standing otitis media may have impacted the patient's auditory function.

It is crucial for the medical team to closely monitor the patient's cardiovascular and neurological status, as well as provide appropriate follow-up care for the otitis media to ensure overall well-being.
