    Calculate the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.

    The CURB-65 calculator can be used in the emergency department setting to risk stratify a patient’s community acquired pneumonia.
    It includes points for confusion, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age.
    
    Parameters:
    confusion (int): Confusion status, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes.
    bun (int): Blood urea nitrogen status, where 0 = BUN ≤ 19 mg/dL (≤ 7 mmol/L urea) and 1 = BUN > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L urea).
    respiratory_rate (int): Respiratory rate status, where 0 = < 30 breaths/min and 1 = ≥ 30 breaths/min.
    blood_pressure (int): Blood pressure status, where 0 = Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg, and 1 = Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg.

    Returns:
    int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

    Usage:
    This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.
    
    Example:
    >>> curb_65_score(1, 1, 1, 0, 1)

STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Calculate the STOP-BANG Score for screening Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

    This score is useful for patients undergoing preoperative evaluation but should not be used if a patient
    has already been diagnosed with OSA or uses CPAP at night. It helps in identifying patients who might have
    OSA and are at increased risk of perioperative cardiopulmonary complications, as well as other morbidity
    associated with OSA like daytime sleepiness and cardiopulmonary conditions.

    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.

    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表被用于评估患者肺炎严重程度？}}
Task Scenario: {{Based on the provided patient's case, the main abnormal part is the presence of cough with blood-tinged sputum, along with fever. The chest CT suggests possible tuberculosis in the right upper lobe and linear shadows in the right middle lobe. These symptoms and imaging findings indicate a pulmonary infection, most likely tuberculosis. 

The patient's medical history includes hypertension and chronic bronchitis, which may have weakened the respiratory system and predisposed the lungs to infections. The elevated blood pressure could also impact the cardiovascular system, potentially affecting the heart's ability to cope with the stress of an infection.

Further investigations and treatment for tuberculosis, including antimicrobial therapy and monitoring of lung function, are necessary to address the impaired pulmonary function in this case.}}
Step By Step Analysis:
