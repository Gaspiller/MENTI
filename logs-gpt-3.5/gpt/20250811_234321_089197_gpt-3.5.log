Detailed information of each tool: {{HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk: Calculate the HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.
    
    The HAS-BLED Score is used to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding and helps guide decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy.
    This scoring system can be considered alongside other bleeding risk scores or thromboembolic risk assessments to weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation.

    Parameters:
    hypertension (bool): True if the patient has hypertension, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has renal disease (dialysis, transplant, or Cr >2.26 mg/dL), False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has liver disease (cirrhosis or bilirubin >2x normal with AST/ALT/AP >3x normal), False otherwise.
    stroke_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, False otherwise.
    major_bleeding_history (bool): True if the patient has had prior major bleeding or predisposition to bleeding, False otherwise.

    The HOMA-IR is a clinical tool used to estimate insulin resistance (IR), which can be
    indicative of potential glucose intolerance and diabetes. It is particularly useful
    in scenarios where more invasive and time-consuming methods like the clamp measurement
    (considered the gold standard for measuring IR) are not feasible. Although the HOMA-IR
    provides a reasonable correlation with clamp measurements, it is less accurate on an
    individual basis, which suggests a need for caution in its clinical application and
    interpretation.

    Parameters:
    - fasting_insulin (float): The fasting insulin level in uIU/mL.
    - fasting_glucose (float): The fasting glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:

    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.


Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity: Calculate the Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity using the Smithline-Gardner Formula.

    This function calculates the serum osmolality/osmolarity based on the concentrations of sodium, glucose,
    and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the blood. Serum osmolality is a measure of the solute concentration in the blood,
    and it can be used to assess the body's fluid and electrolyte balance. An osmolar gap (difference between measured
    and expected osmolality) greater than 10 can indicate the presence of certain toxic alcohols, mannitol, or propylene glycol.

    Note: At extreme levels of serum glucose, such as in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), the osmolar gap may be skewed,
    and clinical judgment should be used.

    Parameters:
    serum_na (float): Serum sodium concentration in mmol/L. Typical reference range is 135-145 mmol/L.
    serum_glucose (float): Serum glucose concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 70-100 mg/dL.
    serum_bun (float): Blood urea nitrogen concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 7-20 mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: Calculated serum osmolality in mOsm/kg.

    Formula:
    Serum Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 2 * (serum_na) + (serum_glucose / 18) + (serum_bun / 2.8)

    Parameters:
    confusion (int): Confusion status, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes.
    bun (int): Blood urea nitrogen status, where 0 = BUN ≤ 19 mg/dL (≤ 7 mmol/L urea) and 1 = BUN > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L urea).
    respiratory_rate (int): Respiratory rate status, where 0 = < 30 breaths/min and 1 = ≥ 30 breaths/min.
    blood_pressure (int): Blood pressure status, where 0 = Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg, and 1 = Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg.
    age (int): Age status, where 0 = < 65 years and 1 = ≥ 65 years.

    Returns:
    int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

    Usage:
    This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.
