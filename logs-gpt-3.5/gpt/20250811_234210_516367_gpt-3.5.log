You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于对上消化道出血患者进行分层评估，以确定是否适合门诊治疗？

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:
The patient is a 65-year-old male who presented with fatigue for 3 days and melena for 1 day, with a significant drop in hemoglobin levels. The clinical diagnosis includes gastric cancer with bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, and a small stone in the left kidney. The patient also has a history of hyperlipidemia, cerebral ischemia, and carotid atherosclerosis.

Evidence:
1. Fatigue and melena are indicative of significant blood loss, leading to iron deficiency anemia.
2. The presence of a large irregular mass in the stomach on imaging and endoscopy suggests gastric cancer with bleeding, leading to the patient's symptoms.
3. The weak positive fecal occult blood test further supports the diagnosis of gastrointestinal bleeding.
4. The patient's low hemoglobin levels and anemia are further evidence of blood loss and impaired iron metabolism.

Speculation:
The abnormality in the patient's case primarily revolves around the gastrointestinal bleeding from gastric cancer. This bleeding has led to iron deficiency anemia and fatigue. Additionally, the patient's kidney stone, hyperlipidemia, cerebral ischemia, and carotid atherosclerosis may complicate his overall health and recovery from the gastric cancer treatment. The impaired iron absorption due to bleeding from gastric cancer could exacerbate the iron deficiency anemia. Treatment focusing on addressing the gastric cancer and managing the anemia will be crucial for the patient's well-being.
