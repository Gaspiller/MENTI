[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估患者进入ICU后的预期疾病严重程度和死亡率？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病例，可以看出患者是因服用农药后出现腹痛、呕吐等症状。从临床表现以及辅助检查结果来看，患者可能受到了农药中毒的影响，这可能导致消化系统以及神经系统功能受损。具体表现为腹痛、恶心、呕吐以及头晕、胸闷、汗多等症状。血液检查结果也显示患者红细胞比容高，可能受到了毒素影响。因此，患者可能需要及时的解毒治疗和支持疗法来恢复相关功能。
