You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估该患者在非心脏手术后心脏并发症的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:
1. The patient was diagnosed with uterine scar, pregnancy with pelvic adhesions, gestational diabetes, congenital heart disease (with previous repair of ventricular septal defect), and undergone IVF-ET. These conditions indicate potential complications with pregnancy and possible impaired fertility.
2. The patient's history of surgery for ectopic pregnancies and repair of ventricular septal defect suggests a history of reproductive health issues and heart conditions.
3. The presence of gestational diabetes during pregnancy indicates impaired glucose metabolism and potential complications for both the mother and baby during pregnancy.
4. The diagnosis of congenital heart disease with mild valve regurgitation suggests a potential impairment in cardiac function, although the patient's current heart function is classified as Class I.
5. Overall, the patient's main abnormal conditions involve reproductive health, glucose metabolism, and cardiac function, which could impact fertility, pregnancy outcomes, and overall cardiovascular health. 

Further monitoring and management may be necessary to ensure a successful pregnancy and optimal health for both the patient and the baby.
