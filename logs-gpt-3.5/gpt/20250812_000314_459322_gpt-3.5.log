[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的肺炎严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和检查结果，可以看出患者主要的问题包括肺部感染、肺水肿、心功能下降（左房扩大、左室舒张功能减低等）、心脏瓣膜病（二尖瓣大量返流、收缩期二尖瓣瓣尖脱入左房）、肺动脉收缩压增高、胆囊壁毛糙、肾囊肿、前列腺增生等。

这些问题可能导致患者出现咳嗽、咳痰、咳血、胸闷、呼吸困难等症状，影响到呼吸功能、心脏功能以及部分消化系统功能。需进一步治疗社区获得性肺炎，并注意监测心脏功能及症状变化。提醒患者及时就医并严格遵医嘱进行治疗。
