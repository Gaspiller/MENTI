[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患儿咽炎是否由链球菌引起的可能性？

Patient Case Analysis:

分析：
1. 患儿出现发热、咳嗽等症状，伴有肺部病变，肺CT显示右肺上叶少许炎性病变，支持了临床诊断的支气管肺炎。
2. 血常规显示中性粒细胞减少，这可能导致免疫功能下降，增加感染风险。
3. 心脏彩超显示心功能正常，但提示二、三尖瓣少量返流，可能存在心肌损害的情况，需要进一步关注。

结论：
1. 患儿的中性粒细胞减少可能会影响其免疫功能，增加感染风险。
2. 肺部炎症以及心脏返流存在，需要密切观察并进行对症治疗以及合理抗感染治疗。
