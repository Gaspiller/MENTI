[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的昏迷程度和神经系统功能？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和检查结果，可以推测患者突发意识障碍是由于右侧基底节区脑出血伴血肿形成所致。这可能导致意识障碍、呼吸困难、瞳孔散大等症状。由于出血破入脑室系统内，可能会对大脑功能造成影响，包括认知能力、肌张力等方面的损害。需要密切监测患者的病情，及时干预治疗以防止进一步恶化。
