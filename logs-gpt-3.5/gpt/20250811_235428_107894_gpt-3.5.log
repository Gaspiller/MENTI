[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的平均动脉压？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病历信息，患者为54岁的女性农民，主诉头晕、头痛、恶心，血压高达240/150mmHg。患者有两年高血压史，未服用降压药。辅助检查显示即刻血糖升高，头颅CT显示双侧基底节区侧脑室旁腔隙性脑梗塞。

根据病历，患者可能存在高血压病导致的脑梗塞，可能与血压过高导致的脑血管病变有关。脑梗塞可能导致患者出现头晕、头痛、恶心等症状。高血压和高血糖也可能加重血管病变的风险。

因此，患者可能出现了高血压导致的脑梗塞，可能存在脑功能受损的情况，需进一步治疗和监测血压控制以预防进一步的并发症。
