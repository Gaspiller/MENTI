[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估该患者肝纤维化的严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病历资料，患者出现反复右胁痛1年，并且加重至右胁部胀痛，特别在饱餐后疼痛尤甚。辅助检查显示肝占位病变、右肺中央型肺癌伴右肺阻塞性不张，以及腹腔淋巴结肿大。这些结果提示患者可能存在肝脏和肺部功能异常，可能涉及到消化系统和呼吸系统的功能受损。进一步的诊断和治疗可能需要重点关注肝脏和肺部疾病的治疗和管理。
