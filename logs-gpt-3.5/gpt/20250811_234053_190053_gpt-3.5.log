You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk', 'Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)', 'Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity', "Wells' Criteria for DVT", 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS)', 'GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7)']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk: Calculate the HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.
    
    The HAS-BLED Score is used to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding and helps guide decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy.
    This scoring system can be considered alongside other bleeding risk scores or thromboembolic risk assessments to weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation.

    Parameters:
    hypertension (bool): True if the patient has hypertension, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has renal disease (dialysis, transplant, or Cr >2.26 mg/dL), False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has liver disease (cirrhosis or bilirubin >2x normal with AST/ALT/AP >3x normal), False otherwise.
    stroke_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, False otherwise.
    major_bleeding_history (bool): True if the patient has had prior major bleeding or predisposition to bleeding, False otherwise.
    labile_inr (bool): True if the patient has labile INR (unstable/high INRs, time in therapeutic range <60%), False otherwise.
    elderly (bool): True if the patient is elderly (age >65), False otherwise.
    medication_risk (bool): True if the patient uses medication that predisposes to bleeding (aspirin, clopidogrel, NSAIDs), False otherwise.
    alcohol_usage (bool): True if the patient consumes alcohol significantly (≥8 drinks/week), False otherwise.

    Returns:
    int: The total HAS-BLED score, which is a sum of all applicable risk factors.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_has_bled_score(True, False, False, True, False, True, True, False, True)

    This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.


Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.

    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,

    The CURB-65 calculator can be used in the emergency department setting to risk stratify a patient’s community acquired pneumonia.
    It includes points for confusion, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age.
    
    Parameters:

    >>> curb_65_score(1, 1, 1, 0, 1)
    4
   

Wells' Criteria for DVT: Calculate the Wells' Criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).

    This scale helps clinicians in outpatient and emergency settings to stratify patients' risk of DVT. A score below 2, coupled with a negative d-dimer test, allows clinicians to rule out DVT without the need for ultrasound imaging. This method balances the need for accurate diagnosis with the resource and time costs associated with more invasive tests.

    Parameters:
    active_cancer (bool): True if the patient has active cancer (treatment within last 6 months).
    bedridden_recently (bool): True if the patient was bedridden for more than 3 days recently or had major surgery within the last 12 weeks.
    calf_swelling (bool): True if the patient's calf swelling exceeds 3 cm compared to the other leg.
    collateral_veins (bool): True if collateral non-varicose superficial veins are present.

    previous_dvt (bool): True if the patient has a history of documented DVT.
    alternative_diagnosis (bool): True if an alternative diagnosis is as likely or more likely than DVT.

    Returns:
    int: Wells' score for DVT, where higher values indicate a higher probability of DVT.

    Usage:
    score = calculate_wells_criteria_dvt(True, False, True, True, False, True, True, False, True, False)

    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.


Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS): Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.

GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7): Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
    based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
    2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

    This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
    including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
    It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
    to assess and monitor treatment responses.

    Parameters:
    - nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
    - control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
    - worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
    - trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
    - restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
    - irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
    - fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

    int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

    Usage Example:
    gad_7_score = calculate_gad_7(3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
    print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score

User Demand: {{哪一个量表用于对上消化道出血患者进行风险评估和分层？}}
Task Scenario: {{根据患者的病史和临床诊断结果显示，患者患有十二指肠球部溃疡并出血，伴有失血性贫血。主要症状包括间断排黑便、头晕、心悸、乏力等。治疗方案中提到了内镜下十二指肠钛夹止血术，这进一步证实了溃疡出血的诊断。由于出血导致失血性贫血，患者可能存在贫血相关的症状，如乏力、心悸等。治疗后患者未再出现黑便，病情有好转。

根据血常规结果显示红细胞计数、血红蛋白浓度和红细胞压积值均下降，初次检查后的血红蛋白为95g/L，再次检查后下降至78g/L，这与失血性贫血的诊断一致。

最终的辅助检查结果显示粪便常规检查中隐血试验阳性，转铁蛋白也呈阳性，进一步确认了存在消化道出血的情况。

总体来看，患者的主要问题是十二指肠球部溃疡并出血导致的失血性贫血，可能会出现贫血相关的症状。治疗措施能够有效控制出血情况，病情有所缓解。}}
