You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的平均动脉压（MAP）？

Patient Case Analysis:

Based on the provided patient's case, the main abnormal parts include:
1. Symptoms of chest tightness, palpitations, and lower limb edema.
2. History of coronary artery atherosclerotic heart disease, heart failure, and hypertension.
3. Elevated blood pressure (145/90mmHg).
4. Lung infection and slightly enlarged heart shadow on chest CT.
5. ECG showing ST-T changes.

Speculated impaired bodily functions may include:
1. Impaired cardiac function due to coronary artery atherosclerosis and heart failure.
2. Impaired pulmonary function due to lung infection.
3. Impaired circulatory function due to hypertension.

Further evaluation and treatment should focus on managing the underlying coronary artery disease, heart failure, and hypertension to improve the patient's overall condition.
