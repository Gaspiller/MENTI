[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者肺炎的严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病史和临床表现，患者出现发热性惊厥，抽搐1次，以及急性上呼吸道感染等症状。这表明患者可能存在神经系统功能异常，导致了惊厥和抽搐。同时，肺炎支原体感染可能导致呼吸道症状，如咳嗽和呼吸困难。综合分析，患者的神经系统和呼吸系统可能存在功能上的问题。因此，要重点关注对这两个系统的进一步治疗和监测。
