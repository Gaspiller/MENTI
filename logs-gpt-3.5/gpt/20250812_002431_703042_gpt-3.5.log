You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA)', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk', 'Morphine Milligram Equivalents (MME) Calculator', 'CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity', 'APACHE II Score', 'Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk', 'HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score: "Calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score which is used to assess the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.
The score is used to track a patient's status during their stay in an intensive care unit to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.
