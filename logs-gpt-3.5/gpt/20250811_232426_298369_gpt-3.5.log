[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的肾小球滤过率？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和临床表现，可以看出他被诊断为慢性肾衰竭CKD5期。在辅助检查中，肾功能指标明显异常，如尿素氮、肌酐和尿酸升高。这表明患者的肾脏功能受损严重，可能导致体内废物无法有效排出，造成乏力、纳差、呕吐等症状。除了上述肾脏问题，患者还患有高血压、心功能不全、贫血和胃炎等疾病，这可能会对血液循环和心脏功能产生影响。因此，患者的各种病症可能相互影响，导致多个器官功能异常。治疗方案中包括血液透析等措施，可以帮助患者改善肾功能，从而缓解相关症状。
