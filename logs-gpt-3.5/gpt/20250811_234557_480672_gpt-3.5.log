[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估该患者在手术后发生心肌梗死或心脏骤停的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和临床诊断，可以推断患者患有桥本氏甲状腺炎。经过甲状腺左侧叶及包块切除手术后，病情得到了好转。主要症状包括发现颈部包块和颈部疼痛不适，甲状腺彩超检查显示甲状腺左侧叶及峡部增厚，甲状腺左侧叶囊性结节，并且甲状腺实质回声增粗不均匀。这些指标表明患者的甲状腺功能可能受损，需要进一步关注甲状腺功能是否受影响。
