[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估患者在子宫肌瘤剔除术前的心脏风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病例资料，患者被诊断为子宫肌瘤和子宫内膜不规则增生。手术方式为子宫肌瘤剔除术，术前进行了VVI型心脏起搏器安置术后的麻醉处理。虽然在手术后病情好转，但需要关注在手术中可能存在的心脏功能方面的风险，因为心脏起搏器对心脏功能有一定影响。需要密切监测患者的心脏功能是否受到影响，并在术后进行定期复查以确保心脏的正常功能。
