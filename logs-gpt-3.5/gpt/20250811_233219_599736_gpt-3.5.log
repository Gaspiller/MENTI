    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.

    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

    Example:

    9

Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

    Parameters:
        age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.
        ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.
        platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).
        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.


Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score: "Calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score which is used to assess the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.
The score is used to track a patient's status during their stay in an intensive care unit to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.

    - bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.


Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA): Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA) using provided weight and height.

    BMI is a measure of body fat based on weight and height that applies to adult men and women.
    It can be misleading for very muscular individuals or in specific ethnic groups with different
    body compositions and statures.

    BSA is often used in medical settings to determine the dosages of medications that are more 
    accurately calculated using body surface area rather than weight.

    Parameters:
    - weight_kg (float): Weight of the individual in kilograms.
    - height_cm (float): Height of the individual in centimeters.

    The MELD Na score incorporates serum creatinine, bilirubin, INR, and sodium levels to determine the severity of liver dysfunction and predict three-month survival.

    Parameters:
    - creatinine (float): Serum creatinine in mg/dL. Minimum value used is 1.0. If patient's creatinine >4.0 or they received ≥2 dialysis treatments in the last 7 days or 24 hours of CVVHD, use 4.0.
    - bilirubin (float): Serum bilirubin in mg/dL. Minimum value used is 1.0.
    - inr (float): International Normalized Ratio (INR), unitless. Minimum value used is 1.0.
    - sodium (float): Serum sodium in mEq/L. Adjusted to be within the range of 125 to 137 mEq/L.

    - cvvhd_hours (int): Hours of continuous veno-venous hemodialysis (CVVHD) within the last 7 days. Default is 0.

    Returns:
    - meld_score (float): The calculated MELD Na score, capped at a maximum of 40.


Wells' Criteria for DVT: Calculate the Wells' Criteria for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT).

    This scale helps clinicians in outpatient and emergency settings to stratify patients' risk of DVT. A score below 2, coupled with a negative d-dimer test, allows clinicians to rule out DVT without the need for ultrasound imaging. This method balances the need for accurate diagnosis with the resource and time costs associated with more invasive tests.

    Parameters:
    active_cancer (bool): True if the patient has active cancer (treatment within last 6 months).
    bedridden_recently (bool): True if the patient was bedridden for more than 3 days recently or had major surgery within the last 12 weeks.

    previous_dvt (bool): True if the patient has a history of documented DVT.
    alternative_diagnosis (bool): True if an alternative diagnosis is as likely or more likely than DVT.

    Returns:
    int: Wells' score for DVT, where higher values indicate a higher probability of DVT.

    Usage:
    score = calculate_wells_criteria_dvt(True, False, True, True, False, True, True, False, True, False)

HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk: Calculate the HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.
    
    The HAS-BLED Score is used to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding and helps guide decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy.
    This scoring system can be considered alongside other bleeding risk scores or thromboembolic risk assessments to weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation.

    Parameters:
    hypertension (bool): True if the patient has hypertension, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has renal disease (dialysis, transplant, or Cr >2.26 mg/dL), False otherwise.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_has_bled_score(True, False, False, True, False, True, True, False, True)
    5

Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia: Calculate the corrected calcium level in patients with suspected hypocalcemia
    who have low albumin levels. Hypocalcemia might not be apparent if serum albumin is low,
    thus this formula adjusts the calcium level based on albumin discrepancy.

    Args:
    normal_albumin (float): The normal albumin level in g/dL assumed for the calculation.
    patient_albumin (float): The patient's measured albumin level in g/dL.
    serum_ca (float): The patient's measured serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: The corrected serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Example:
    >>> corrected_calcium(4.0, 3.2, 8.5)
