PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP: Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
    It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

    Parameters:

CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.


Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia: Calculate the Corrected Sodium for Hyperglycemia using Hillier's method from 1999.

    This function computes the corrected sodium level in patients with hyperglycemia,
    accounting for osmotic shifts of water from the intracellular to the extracellular space,
    which can lead to dilutional hyponatremia. The formula uses a correction factor of 2.4 mEq/L
    for every 100 mg/dL increase in serum glucose above the normal threshold of 100 mg/dL.

    Parameters:
        measured_sodium (float): The measured sodium level in mEq/L.
        serum_glucose (float): The serum glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
        float: The corrected sodium level in mEq/L.

    Example:
        >>> sodium_correction_hyperglycemia(140, 200)
        142.4

Maintenance Fluids Calculations: Calculate the Maintenance Fluids rate using the "4-2-1" Rule.
    
    This function determines the intravenous (IV) fluid rate for patients who are not taking oral fluids,
    addressing needs such as vomiting, NPO status, dehydration, insensible losses, or third spacing. It uses
    a weight-based dosing method to ensure appropriate fluid volume according to patient's weight.
    
    Parameters:
    - weight (float): The weight of the patient in kilograms.
    
    Returns:
    - float: The calculated IV fluid rate in mL per hour.
    
    Usage:
    - This calculation is crucial in medical settings where accurate fluid replacement is necessary,
      particularly in settings where patients cannot intake fluids orally.
    
    Example:
    - calculate_maintenance_fluids(25)  # Calculates fluid rate for a 25 kg patient.

APACHE II Score: Calculate the APACHE II Score for a patient in the ICU, to assess severity and predict mortality.

    Parameters:

    - acute_renal_failure (int): Indicates if the patient has acute renal failure, with 0 for 'No' and 1 for 'Yes'.
    - fio2 (int): Fraction of inspired oxygen, 0 for '<50%' and 1 for '≥50%'.
    - pao2 (float, optional): Partial pressure of arterial oxygen, required if FiO2 < 50%.
    - a_a_gradient (float, optional): Alveolar-arterial gradient, required if FiO2 ≥ 50%.

    Returns:
    - int: The computed APACHE II score.


CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity: 
    Calculate the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.

    The CURB-65 calculator can be used in the emergency department setting to risk stratify a patient’s community acquired pneumonia.
    It includes points for confusion, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age.
    
    Parameters:
    confusion (int): Confusion status, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes.
    bun (int): Blood urea nitrogen status, where 0 = BUN ≤ 19 mg/dL (≤ 7 mmol/L urea) and 1 = BUN > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L urea).
    respiratory_rate (int): Respiratory rate status, where 0 = < 30 breaths/min and 1 = ≥ 30 breaths/min.
    blood_pressure (int): Blood pressure status, where 0 = Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg, and 1 = Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg.

    Returns:
    int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

    Usage:
    This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.
    
    Example:
    >>> curb_65_score(1, 1, 1, 0, 1)
    4
   

HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance): Calculate the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).

    The HOMA-IR is a clinical tool used to estimate insulin resistance (IR), which can be
    indicative of potential glucose intolerance and diabetes. It is particularly useful
    in scenarios where more invasive and time-consuming methods like the clamp measurement
    (considered the gold standard for measuring IR) are not feasible. Although the HOMA-IR
    provides a reasonable correlation with clamp measurements, it is less accurate on an
    individual basis, which suggests a need for caution in its clinical application and
    interpretation.

    Parameters:
    - fasting_insulin (float): The fasting insulin level in uIU/mL.
    - fasting_glucose (float): The fasting glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR score).

    Formula:
    HOMA-IR score = (fasting insulin * fasting glucose) / 405

Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.
    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.
 

Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia: Calculate the corrected calcium level in patients with suspected hypocalcemia
    who have low albumin levels. Hypocalcemia might not be apparent if serum albumin is low,
    thus this formula adjusts the calcium level based on albumin discrepancy.

    Args:
    normal_albumin (float): The normal albumin level in g/dL assumed for the calculation.
    patient_albumin (float): The patient's measured albumin level in g/dL.
    serum_ca (float): The patient's measured serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: The corrected serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Example:
    >>> corrected_calcium(4.0, 3.2, 8.5)
    8.84
