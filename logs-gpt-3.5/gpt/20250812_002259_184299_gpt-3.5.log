Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa): Calculate the Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa) in percentage.
    
    The FENa is a clinical tool used to evaluate oliguria and/or acute kidney injury of unclear etiology. It is most
    accurate in patients with oliguric acute kidney injury who have not been treated with diuretics, do not have
    chronic kidney disease, urinary tract obstruction, or acute glomerular disease.
    
    Parameters:
    serum_creatinine (float): Serum creatinine concentration (mg/dL)
    urine_sodium (float): Urine sodium concentration (mmol/L)
    serum_sodium (float): Serum sodium concentration (mmol/L)

    Note:
    FENa is calculated using the formula:
    FENa (%) = 100 × (serum_creatinine × urine_sodium) / (serum_sodium × urine_creatinine)

Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity: Calculate the Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity using the Smithline-Gardner Formula.

    This function calculates the serum osmolality/osmolarity based on the concentrations of sodium, glucose,
    and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the blood. Serum osmolality is a measure of the solute concentration in the blood,
    and it can be used to assess the body's fluid and electrolyte balance. An osmolar gap (difference between measured
    and expected osmolality) greater than 10 can indicate the presence of certain toxic alcohols, mannitol, or propylene glycol.

    Note: At extreme levels of serum glucose, such as in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), the osmolar gap may be skewed,
    and clinical judgment should be used.

    Parameters:
    serum_na (float): Serum sodium concentration in mmol/L. Typical reference range is 135-145 mmol/L.
    serum_glucose (float): Serum glucose concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 70-100 mg/dL.
    serum_bun (float): Blood urea nitrogen concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 7-20 mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: Calculated serum osmolality in mOsm/kg.

    Formula:
    Serum Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 2 * (serum_na) + (serum_glucose / 18) + (serum_bun / 2.8)
