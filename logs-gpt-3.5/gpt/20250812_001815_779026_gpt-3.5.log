[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于计算高血糖患者的实际钠水平？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病例信息，患者被诊断为2型糖尿病并伴有糖尿病肾病和视网膜病变。在辅助检查中显示患者血糖升高，血常规、凝血全套、乙肝三系列测定、尿常规、血脂、肝功能、甲状腺功能、颈部血管超声和心脏超声等方面存在明显异常。因此，患者可能存在胰岛素分泌异常或胰岛素抵抗导致的血糖控制不佳，同时可能出现肾功能和心脏功能方面的问题。需密切监测和针对性治疗以维持病情稳定。
