You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表可用于评估该患者10年内发作冠状动脉性心脏病的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:
The main abnormal parts of the patient's case include coronary artery heart disease with three-vessel disease, old myocardial infarction, unstable angina, severe hypertension (3rd stage), type 2 diabetes, and impaired high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels.

Speculated impaired bodily functions:
1. Cardiovascular function: The patient has a history of coronary artery heart disease with three-vessel disease, old myocardial infarction, and unstable angina. This indicates impaired cardiovascular function, specifically coronary artery circulation and heart muscle function.
2. Metabolic function: The patient has type 2 diabetes, which indicates impaired insulin function and glucose metabolism.
3. Lipid metabolism: The patient has significantly low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, which indicates impaired lipid metabolism and may contribute to the progression of coronary artery disease.

Overall, the patient's case highlights impairments in cardiovascular, metabolic, and lipid metabolism functions, necessitating comprehensive treatment and management strategies.
