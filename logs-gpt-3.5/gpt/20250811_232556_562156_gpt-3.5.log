You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于估算慢性肾炎患者的肾小球滤过率（GFR）？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病史和辅助检查结果，可以看出患者患有慢性肾盂肾炎。主要症状包括反复发作腰部酸痛、尿频、尿急、尿痛，尿常规显示白细胞增多，肾功能检查显示肌酐略高。这些表现表明患者肾盂和肾实质受到感染和炎症影响，可能导致肾功能受损，尤其是影响了尿液的排泄和生成功能。治疗方案主要针对炎症进行治疗，例如饮食控制、补充水分、注射抗生素等。治疗结果显示病情得到了好转。因此，患者可能存在尿路感染引起的肾盂肾炎，可能会影响肾功能和尿液排泄功能。
