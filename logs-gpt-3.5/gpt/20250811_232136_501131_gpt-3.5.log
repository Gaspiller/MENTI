[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于估计慢性肾炎患者的肾小球滤过率？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和检查结果显示，患者出现颜面部及双下肢水肿，可能是由于肾功能异常导致的水潴留。肾脏彩超显示双肾多发囊肿和右肾多发结石，尿常规显示红细胞和白细胞增多，肾功能指标肌酐和尿酸升高。这些异常结果表明可能存在肾功能不全或慢性肾炎的情况。另外，右肾结石也可能影响尿液排泄功能，导致水潴留。建议进一步评估肾功能，以便及时干预和治疗。
