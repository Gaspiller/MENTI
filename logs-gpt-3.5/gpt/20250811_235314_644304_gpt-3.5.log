[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的平均动脉压（MAP）？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和临床表现，可以看出患者出现了精神症状，包括兴奋、话多、逻辑混乱、情绪波动等，且存在妄想和冲动行为。根据治疗方案中使用的药物和病情好转的情况来看，病因诊断为颅内感染所致精神障碍，可能影响了患者的认知功能、情绪控制和行为调节能力。治疗措施主要是控制兴奋、冲动和精神病性症状，进一步治疗可能需要继续注重精神状态的调节和抑制症状的发作。
