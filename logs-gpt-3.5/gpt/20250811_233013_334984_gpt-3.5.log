[input]   
You are a Parameter List checking model.

You will receive a Function Docstring, and Parameter List. You need to verify that the entries in the Parameter List comply with the requirements described in the Function Docstring, including the Value and Unit.
If all units are consistent, choose "calculate". If there are any discrepancies in the units, choose "toolcall".
You should not perform unit conversions directly. When converting units is needed, you must choose "toolcall" and elaborate on this unit conversion task in the "supplementary_information", including the parameter value, the current unit of the parameter, and the target unit of the parameter.

Requirements:
1. You need to conduct a detailed, step-by-step analysis of each parameter in the parameter list. You need to output each parameter's Function Docstring individually, then analyze and compare them.
2. You especially need to compare the Unit of the Parameter List with the units required in the Function Docstring. 
3. If the units are inconsistent, please select "toolcall" and specify the numerical value of the parameter required for unit conversion, as well as the units before and after the conversion in the "supplementary_information".
4. The unit conversion task may require converting units of different parameters, and you need to break down the task into individual unit conversion tasks for each parameter. Therefore, "supplementary_information" is a list of strings, each of which represents a standalone, minimalized unit conversion task.
5. The Final Answer is a JSON file, and the JSON file must be wrapped by ```json and ```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring:
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Parameter List：
{{{
    "weight": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "kg"},
    "height": {"Value": 1.75, "Unit": "m"}
}}}
Step By Step Analysis:
{{(Here is your step-by-step analysis. You need to ouptput the corresponding Function Docstring first for each parameter, and systematically compare each parameter with the corresponding information in the Parameter List and Function Docstring.)}}
Final Answer:

Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.

    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of renal disease, False otherwise.
    altered_mental_status (bool): True if the patient has altered mental status, False otherwise.
    respiratory_rate (bool): True if respiratory rate is ≥30 breaths/min, False otherwise.
    systolic_bp (bool): True if systolic blood pressure is <90 mmHg, False otherwise.
    temperature (bool): True if temperature is <35°C or >39.9°C, False otherwise.
    pulse (bool): True if pulse rate is ≥125 beats/min, False otherwise.
    blood_ph (bool): True if blood pH is <7.35, False otherwise.
    bun (bool): True if BUN is ≥30 mg/dL or ≥11 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    sodium (bool): True if sodium level is <130 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    glucose (bool): True if glucose level is ≥250 mg/dL or ≥14 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    hematocrit (bool): True if hematocrit is <30%, False otherwise.
    oxygen_pressure (bool): True if partial pressure of oxygen is <60 mmHg or <8 kPa, False otherwise.

Step By Step Analysis:
{{The age parameter is specified in years and requires no conversion. The sex parameter is specified as either 'Female' or 'Male' and is consistent. The nursing_home_resident, neoplastic_disease, liver_disease, chf_history, cerebrovascular_disease, renal_disease, altered_mental_status, respiratory_rate, bun, sodium parameters do not have unit requirements and are consistent. 

However, the systolic_bp, temperature, pulse, blood_ph, glucose, hematocrit, oxygen_pressure parameters have unit requirements in the Function Docstring that are not specified in the Parameter List. Therefore, they need to be converted to the correct units.}}
