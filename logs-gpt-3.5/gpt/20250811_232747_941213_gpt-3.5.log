You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}

Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score which is used to assess the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.
The score is used to track a patient's status during their stay in an intensive care unit to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.

Parameters:
- pao2_fio2_ratio (float): The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (mmHg).

- bilirubin (float): Serum bilirubin in mg/dL.
- map_pressure (float): Mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
- vasoactive_agents (int): Index indicating the vasoactive agents being used. Corresponds to 0 for no agents, 1 for low dose dopamine or any dose dobutamine, 2 for higher dose dopamine or low dose epinephrine/norepinephrine, 3 for very high dose of these agents.
- creatinine (float): Serum creatinine in mg/dL.
- urine_output (float): Urine output in mL/day.
- o2_delivery_type (int): Index of the type of oxygen delivery method used. Types are as follows: 0 = nasal cannula, 1 = simple face mask, 2 = non-rebreather mask, 3 = high-flow nasal cannula.
- o2_flow_rate (float): Flow rate of oxygen delivery in L/min.

Returns:
int: Total SOFA score which is the sum of individual scores across the specified parameters."}}

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Extract the parameter "pao2_fio2_ratio":
   - The reference text does not contain direct information about the patient's arterial oxygen partial pressure (PaO2) and fractional inspired oxygen (FiO2) levels required to calculate the ratio. As a result, we will make an inference based on the patient's respiratory history and the presence of lung infection.
   - Since the patient has presented with symptoms such as coughing and sputum production, along with a chest CT showing lung infection, it is likely that the patient has respiratory distress and decreased oxygen levels. Therefore, we can infer that the PaO2/FiO2 ratio is abnormal.
   - Assuming an abnormal value of PaO2/FiO2 ratio, we will randomly assign a value for this parameter while ensuring it is a positive float value.

2. Extract the parameter "platelets":
   - The reference text mentions the patient's platelet count as "BUN:3.9mmol/L." However, this information is regarding the blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level and not platelet count.
   - Since the platelet count is not explicitly provided in the reference text, we will randomly assign a value for this parameter ensuring it is a positive float value.

3. Extract the parameter "glasgow_coma_scale":
   - The Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score is used to assess a patient's level of consciousness. The reference text provides information on the patient's mental status, such as "神志模糊言语不清" (confused and unclear speech).
   - Based on the description of the patient's presentation, we can infer that the patient's GCS score is likely reduced. Therefore, we will randomly assign a GCS score within the range suitable for a confused state (e.g., between 5 and 12).

4. Extract the parameter "bilirubin":
   - The reference text does not explicitly mention the patient's serum bilirubin level. Since bilirubin is a parameter required for the SOFA score calculation, we will randomly assign a value for this parameter ensuring it is a positive float value.

5. Extract the parameter "map_pressure":
   - The reference text provides the patient's blood pressure as "BP：130/86mmHg." The mean arterial pressure (MAP) can be calculated using the formula: MAP = (2 * diastolic BP + systolic BP) / 3. Therefore, we can determine the MAP value based on the provided blood pressure values.
   - Extracted MAP value: Calculated using the formula based on the provided blood pressure values.

6. Extract the parameter "vasoactive_agents":
   - The reference text does not directly mention the use of vasoactive agents for the patient. Since this information is crucial for the SOFA score calculation, we will randomly assign an index value based on the patient's critical condition that may require vasoactive agents.

7. Extract the parameter "creatinine":
   - The reference text does not explicitly state the patient's serum creatinine level. Since creatinine is vital for the SOFA score calculation, we will randomly assign a value for this parameter ensuring it is a positive float value.

8. Extract the parameter "urine_output":
   - The reference text does not provide specific information on the patient's urine output. Since urine output is essential for assessing kidney function in the SOFA score calculation, we will randomly assign a value for this parameter ensuring it is a positive float value.

9. Extract the parameter "o2_delivery_type":
   - The reference text does not mention the specific type of oxygen delivery method used for the patient. Since the oxygen delivery type is crucial for the SOFA score calculation, we will randomly assign an index value corresponding to the type of oxygen delivery method based on the patient's reported symptoms.

10. Extract the parameter "o2_flow_rate":
    - The reference text does not provide details on the patient's oxygen flow rate. Since the oxygen flow rate is important for the SOFA score calculation, we will randomly assign a value for this parameter ensuring it is a positive float value.
