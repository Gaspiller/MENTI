[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于计算患者的平均动脉压（MAP）？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和临床表现，他被锐器刺伤左胸部导致穿透性心脏损伤和急性心脏压塞。手术治疗包括全身麻醉下行心脏裂口修补术，这表明他可能出现了心包积液导致的心脏压塞。辅助检查显示心脏X线显示心影增大且心梗消失，心电图呈现窦速和ST-T改变，血液检查显示贫血。这些结果暗示患者的心脏功能受损，可能导致心功能不全和心脏压塞等问题。
