You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:

The patient presents with a case of 21-trisomy syndrome, also known as Down syndrome, which was detected through umbilical cord blood puncture. This condition is characterized by the presence of an extra chromosome 21, leading to developmental delays, intellectual disabilities, and distinctive facial features.

Given the patient's advanced maternal age and the presence of 21-trisomy syndrome in the fetus, it may suggest impaired reproductive function related to chromosomal abnormalities. The patient's decision to undergo induced abortion may be due to the high-risk nature of the pregnancy.

It is important to consider genetic counseling and further evaluation to determine any underlying genetic factors contributing to the development of 21-trisomy syndrome in the fetus. Additional prenatal screening and diagnostic tests may be recommended for future pregnancies to assess the risk of chromosomal abnormalities and potential reproductive concerns.
