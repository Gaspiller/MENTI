[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估患者的神志状态和意识水平？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和体征表现，可以初步推断患者可能患有代谢性疾病，特别是电解质紊乱，如低钠血症、低钾血症和低氯血症。这可能解释了患者出现的恶心、呕吐、意识模糊和牙关紧闭等症状。

此外，生化检查结果显示患者血清中钠、氯、蛋白和钙等指标异常，这也支持了电解质紊乱的推断。

需要进一步的检查以明确诊断，并及时进行相应治疗以纠正电解质紊乱，改善患者的症状和情况。
