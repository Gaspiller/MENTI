2025-08-11 23:38:40,876 - INFO - 1. Extract the eye_response parameter:
   - In the Reference Text, there is no clear indication of the patient's eye response score.
   - Based on the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring, the possible scores for eye response are 4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none).
   - Since the patient cannot open their eyes as mentioned in the Reference Text, the most appropriate score would be 1 (none).

2. Extract the verbal_response parameter:
   - In the Reference Text, there is no explicit mention of the patient's verbal response score.
   - According to the scoring standards, the possible scores for verbal response are 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words), 2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response).
   - The patient exhibits symptoms of altered consciousness and confusion, indicating a verbal response score of 4 (confused).

3. Extract the motor_response parameter:
   - In the Reference Text, there is no specific description of the patient's motor response score.
   - The motor response scores can be 6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain), 3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response).
   - Since the patient's responses are not detailed, based on the lack of motor responses mentioned, a motor score of 1 (no motor response) would be appropriate.

    "eye_response": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"},
    "verbal_response": {"Value": 4, "Unit": "null"},
    "motor_response": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"}

2025-08-11 23:38:46,492 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.}}
Parameter List：
{{{
    "eye_response": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"},
    "verbal_response": {"Value": 4, "Unit": "null"},
    "motor_response": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"}
}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
1. eye_response:
   Function Docstring specifies that the eye_response parameter can take values of 1, 2, 3, or 4 representing different levels of eye response. The unit is "null" indicating a categorical value.
   Parameter List provides a value of 1 for eye_response.
   Comparing the provided value of 1 with the allowed values (1, 2, 3, 4), the parameter value is within the valid range.
  
2. verbal_response:
   Function Docstring specifies that the verbal_response parameter can take values of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 representing different levels of verbal response. The unit is "null" indicating a categorical value.
   Parameter List provides a value of 4 for verbal_response.
   Comparing the provided value of 4 with the allowed values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5), the parameter value is within the valid range.

3. motor_response:
   Function Docstring specifies that the motor_response parameter can take values of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6 representing different levels of motor response. The unit is "null" indicating a categorical value.
   Parameter List provides a value of 1 for motor_response.
   Comparing the provided value of 1 with the allowed values (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), the parameter value is within the valid range.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use categorical values."
}
