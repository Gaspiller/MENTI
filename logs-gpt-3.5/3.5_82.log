2025-08-12 00:10:08,859 - INFO - 1. The user demand is asking for a tool that evaluates a patient's cardiac risk before undergoing a Chorionic Villus Sampling (CVS), which is a prenatal diagnostic procedure used to detect chromosomal abnormalities such as trisomy 18.

2. The tool that best fits this scenario is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk." This tool is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, which includes procedures like CVS.

3. To use the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" tool, we need to know if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular, any history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, preoperative treatment with insulin, and preoperative creatinine levels.

4. Since the scenario involves a patient considering a CVS due to the high risk of trisomy 18, it is crucial to assess the patient's cardiac risk before undergoing such a procedure to ensure a safe outcome.

5. Therefore, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List for this scenario is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-12 00:10:20,364 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
