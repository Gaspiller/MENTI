2025-08-11 23:52:07,186 - INFO - 1. Based on the user demand of predicting the risk of major cardiac events within 6 weeks, we need a tool that can assess the cardiac risk factors and stratify patients into risk categories.

2. The tool that best fits this scenario is the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events. This tool calculates the risk score based on history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels, which are key factors in assessing the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in patients presenting with chest pain.

3. Given the patient's history of angina symptoms, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cerebral artery stenosis, the HEART Score can provide a comprehensive assessment of the patient's cardiovascular risk profile and help in predicting the likelihood of major cardiac events.

4. By using the HEART Score, healthcare providers can stratify the patient into low, moderate, or high-risk categories, which can guide further management decisions and interventions to prevent adverse cardiac outcomes.

2025-08-11 23:52:10,081 - INFO - 1. history_score:
Based on the patient's clinical history provided in the reference text, the patient has a history of coronary artery atherosclerotic heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and narrowing of cerebral arteries. These factors indicate a high suspicion of a major cardiac event and would likely correspond to a history_score of 2.

2. ekg_score:
The reference text states that the patient has normal EKG findings. Therefore, the ekg_score would be 0.

3. age_score:
The patient's age is provided as 55 years old in the reference text, falling between the age categories specified in the function docstring. Thus, the age_score would be 1.

4. risk_factors_score:
The patient has a history of hyperlipidemia, hypertension, and atherosclerotic disease, which are all cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, the risk_factors_score would be 2.

5. troponin_score:
The reference text mentions that the patient's troponin levels are within the normal range. Therefore, the troponin_score would be 0.

2025-08-11 23:52:14,392 - INFO - {{Calculate the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
