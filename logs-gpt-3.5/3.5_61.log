2. The "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" tool is used to calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). This metric is crucial in assessing tissue perfusion, blood flow, and is particularly important in medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, and hypertensive emergencies.

3. Considering the patient's case with symptoms of chest tightness, palpitations, lower limb edema, history of coronary artery atherosclerotic heart disease, heart failure, hypertension, elevated blood pressure, lung infection, and ECG changes, the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) tool will aid in assessing the patient's circulatory status and perfusion.

Based on this analysis, the most suitable tool to use for evaluating the patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) in this scenario is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" tool.

{{Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333}}

Step By Step Analysis:
1. Analyzing parameter "systolic_bp":
    - Function Docstring specifies: Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    - Parameter List has the value 145 and unit mmHg which is consistent with the Function Docstring.
    - Conclusion: Parameter "systolic_bp" is compliant.
2. Analyzing parameter "diastolic_bp":
    - Function Docstring specifies: Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    - Parameter List has the value 90 and unit mmHg which is consistent with the Function Docstring.
    - Conclusion: Parameter "diastolic_bp" is compliant.
Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use the same units specified in the Function Docstring."
