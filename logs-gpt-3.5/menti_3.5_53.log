2. 根据用户情境描述，患者可能出现了慢性心力衰竭、扩张型心肌病、心功能Ⅳ级、心律失常、心房颤动等症状，心脏超声、冠脉造影及其他检查结果显示多种心脏和肺部异常，说明患者存在心功能减低、心脏功能不全和慢性阻塞性肺疾病急性发作等情况。

3. 在量表列表中，根据上述情况，最适合选择的工具是"HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"，因为该量表可以根据患者的心绞痛情况进行风险分层，将患者分为低、中、高风险组，从而辅助急诊科医生在急性冠脉综合征患者的进一步管理。

2025-08-11 23:49:30,019 - INFO - 1. history_score:
   - From the reference text, the patient has a history of chest pain, palpitations, and shortness of breath for 12 years, with worsening symptoms in the past day. Additionally, the patient has been diagnosed with coronary heart disease (possible ischemic heart disease) and heart failure.
   - Given the long history of cardiac symptoms, coronary artery disease, and heart failure, the history_score should be considered "Highly suspicious" with a score of 2.

2. ekg_score:
   - The EKG findings mentioned in the reference text include atrial fibrillation, ventricular premature beats, and ST-T changes. These findings indicate significant cardiac electrical abnormalities.
   - Based on the mentioned EKG findings, the ekg_score should be classified as "Significant ST deviation" with a score of 2.

3. age_score:
   - The patient's age is provided as 80 years old in the reference text.
   - According to the age categories defined in the function docstring, the age_score should be categorized as "65 or older" with a score of 2.

4. risk_factors_score:
   - The reference text mentions the patient has a history of coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, and atherosclerosis. These conditions are indicative of multiple cardiovascular risk factors.
   - Considering the significant cardiovascular comorbidities, the risk_factors_score should be rated as "3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease" with a score of 2.

5. troponin_score:
   - The troponin level of the patient is described as elevated with values greater than normal limits.
   - Based on the elevated troponin levels, the troponin_score should be "2 = >3 times normal limit."

2025-08-11 23:49:35,172 - INFO - Function Docstring:
 Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
