   - In the Reference Text, the patient's biological sex is female.
   - Therefore, the sex parameter value is female.

3. history_of_congestive_heart_failure:
   - In the Reference Text, it is mentioned that the patient has a history of congestive heart failure.
   - Therefore, the history_of_congestive_heart_failure parameter value is True.

4. history_of_hypertension:
   - In the Reference Text, there is no explicit mention of hypertension in the patient's history.
   - Since hypertension is a common comorbidity with heart conditions, it can be inferred that the patient might have a history of hypertension.
   - Therefore, the history_of_hypertension parameter value is True.

5. history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism:
   - In the Reference Text, it is indicated that the patient has a history of stroke (心房纤颤), which can be considered equivalent to stroke in the context of CHA2DS2-VASc scoring.
   - Therefore, the history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism parameter value is True.

6. history_of_vascular_disease:
   - In the Reference Text, there is no explicit mention of vascular disease in the patient's history.
   - As the patient has a history of myocardial infarction (冠心病), which falls under vascular disease, it can be inferred that the patient has a history of vascular disease.
   - Therefore, the history_of_vascular_disease parameter value is True.

7. history_of_diabetes:
   - In the Reference Text, there is no explicit mention of diabetes mellitus in the patient's history.
   - Since diabetes is a common comorbidity with heart conditions, it can be inferred that the patient might have a history of diabetes.
   - Therefore, the history_of_diabetes parameter value is True.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
    - history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(75, 'female', True, True, True, True, True)
