2025-08-12 00:14:12,898 - INFO - 1. Based on the User Demand, the tool needed is one that assesses the risk of major cardiac complications in patients after non-cardiac surgery.
2. The tool that best fits the task scenario and user demand is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk". This tool is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery.
3. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index takes into account specific risk factors such as elevated risk surgery, history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, preoperative treatment with insulin, and preoperative creatinine levels.
4. By using the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, healthcare providers can accurately assess the cardiac risk of the patient and make informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
5. Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk".

2025-08-12 00:14:17,303 - INFO - 1. elevated_risk_surgery:
Based on the description in the Reference Text, there is no mention of the type of surgery the patient underwent. However, the patient underwent a cesarean section with adhesiolysis, which is not classified as intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular surgery. Therefore, we can infer that elevated_risk_surgery should be False.

2. history_of_ischemic_heart_disease:
The patient has a medical history of congenital heart disease, but there is no explicit mention of a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy. Considering the patient's young age and the absence of specific symptoms in the Reference Text, we can infer that history_of_ischemic_heart_disease should be False.

3. history_of_congestive_heart_failure:
There is no indication in the Reference Text that the patient has signs of congestive heart failure such as pulmonary edema, rales, S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or findings on the chest X-ray. Therefore, history_of_congestive_heart_failure should be False.

4. history_of_cerebrovascular_disease:
There is no mention of a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke in the Reference Text. Thus, history_of_cerebrovascular_disease should be False.

5. preop_treatment_with_insulin:
The patient's treatment regime does not include pre-operative insulin therapy based on the absence of any mention of insulin treatment. Therefore, preop_treatment_with_insulin should be False.

6. preop_creatinine_above_threshold:
The preoperative creatinine levels of the patient are not stated in the Reference Text. As a result, we do not have definitive information to determine whether preop_creatinine_above_threshold should be True or False.

2025-08-12 00:14:23,978 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
