2025-08-12 00:22:07,815 - INFO - 1. The user demand is to identify which tool is used to assess pre-operative cardiac risk in patients.
2. Based on the task scenario provided, it is evident that the patient has significant liver injury and associated complications due to self-ingestion of rodenticide, stab wounds to the chest and abdomen resulting in liver contusion, abdominal fluid accumulation, and hemorrhagic anemia.
3. Given the liver-related complications and the need to assess pre-operative cardiac risk, the most suitable tool from the tool list would be the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
4. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is specifically designed to evaluate the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent non-cardiac surgery, taking into account specific risk factors such as a history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, pre-operative insulin treatment, and elevated pre-operative creatinine levels.
5. By using the Revised Cardiac Risk Index in this patient's case, healthcare providers can better assess the patient's cardiac risk and make informed decisions regarding pre-operative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
6. Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List based on the User Demand and Task Scenario is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-12 00:22:15,746 - INFO - 1. **elevated_risk_surgery**
   - From the Reference Text, there is no direct mention of the type of surgery the patient underwent, so we can infer that the surgery was not intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
   - Therefore, we can set the value of elevated_risk_surgery to False.

2. **history_of_ischemic_heart_disease**
   - There is no mention of a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, chest pain due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy in the Reference Text.
   - However, since the patient had chest pain and signs of myocardial injury due to the chest stab wound, we can infer that there is a history of ischemic heart disease.
   - Therefore, we can set the value of history_of_ischemic_heart_disease to True.

3. **history_of_congestive_heart_failure**
   - There is no direct mention of signs of congestive heart failure in the Reference Text.
   - Since the patient had signs of volume overload such as pulmonary edema and chest X-ray findings suggestive of pulmonary vascular redistribution, we can infer that there is a history of congestive heart failure.
   - Therefore, we can set the value of history_of_congestive_heart_failure to True.

4. **history_of_cerebrovascular_disease**
   - The patient does not have a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke as per the Reference Text.
   - Therefore, we can set the value of history_of_cerebrovascular_disease to False.

5. **preop_treatment_with_insulin**
   - There is no mention of the patient being treated with insulin pre-operatively in the Reference Text.
   - Therefore, we can set the value of preop_treatment_with_insulin to False.

6. **preop_creatinine_above_threshold**
   - The Reference Text states that the patient has normal preoperative creatinine levels.
   - Therefore, we can set the value of preop_creatinine_above_threshold to False.

2025-08-12 00:22:20,915 - INFO - {{"Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
