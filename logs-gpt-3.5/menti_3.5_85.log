2025-08-12 00:11:17,413 - INFO - 1. Parameter: elevated_risk_surgery
- Reference Text: The patient is a 28-year-old female.
- Analysis: The reference text does not provide direct information about the type of surgery the patient is undergoing. However, based on the patient's age and gender, it is unlikely that she is undergoing intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular surgery, which are considered elevated-risk surgeries.
- Value: False

2. Parameter: history_of_ischemic_heart_disease
- Reference Text: The patient has no history of ischemic heart disease. She denies chronic diseases like hypertension, coronary heart disease, and diabetes.
- Value: False

3. Parameter: history_of_congestive_heart_failure
- Reference Text: The patient has no history of congestive heart failure. There are no signs indicating pulmonary edema, bilateral rales, or other symptoms of heart failure.
- Value: False

4. Parameter: history_of_cerebrovascular_disease
- Reference Text: The patient has no history of cerebrovascular disease.
- Value: False

5. Parameter: preop_treatment_with_insulin
- Reference Text: The patient has no mention of pre-operative treatment with insulin.
- Value: False

6. Parameter: preop_creatinine_above_threshold
- Reference Text: The patient's pre-operative creatinine level is normal. There is no indication of elevated creatinine levels.
- Value: False

2025-08-12 00:11:25,532 - INFO - {{"Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.

Step By Step Analysis:
1. Parameter "elevated_risk_surgery":
Function Docstring specifies that this should be a boolean value indicating if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular. The unit for this parameter should be "null" according to the Function Docstring. The value provided in the Parameter List is false, which is a valid boolean value. The unit also matches the requirement. Therefore, no unit conversion is needed.

2. Parameter "history_of_ischemic_heart_disease":
Function Docstring specifies that this should be a boolean value indicating if there is a history of specific heart conditions. The unit for this parameter should be "null" according to the Function Docstring. The value provided in the Parameter List is false, which is a valid boolean value. The unit also matches the requirement. Therefore, no unit conversion is needed.

3. Parameter "history_of_congestive_heart_failure":
Function Docstring specifies that this should be a boolean value indicating if there are specific signs related to heart failure. The unit for this parameter should be "null" according to the Function Docstring. The value provided in the Parameter List is false, which is a valid boolean value. The unit also matches the requirement. Therefore, no unit conversion is needed.

4. Parameter "history_of_cerebrovascular_disease":
Function Docstring specifies that this should be a boolean value indicating if there is a history of specific cerebrovascular conditions. The unit for this parameter should be "null" according to the Function Docstring. The value provided in the Parameter List is false, which is a valid boolean value. The unit also matches the requirement. Therefore, no unit conversion is needed.

5. Parameter "preop_treatment_with_insulin":
Function Docstring specifies that this should be a boolean value indicating if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively. The unit for this parameter should be "null" according to the Function Docstring. The value provided in the Parameter List is false, which is a valid boolean value. The unit also matches the requirement. Therefore, no unit conversion is needed.

6. Parameter "preop_creatinine_above_threshold":
Function Docstring specifies that this should be a boolean value indicating if the pre-operative creatinine levels exceed a certain threshold. The unit for this parameter should be "null" according to the Function Docstring. The value provided in the Parameter List is false, which is a valid boolean value. The unit also matches the requirement. Therefore, no unit conversion is needed.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters do not have units (null)."
}
