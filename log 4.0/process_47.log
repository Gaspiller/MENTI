2025-08-17 16:54:52,862 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to predict the risk of major cardiac events within 6 weeks. This aligns with the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events, which is designed to risk-stratify patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with impaired cardiac function, abnormalities in heart parameters, symptoms of heart failure, and signs indicating possible myocardial infarction. These clinical details strongly suggest a scenario where assessing the risk of major cardiac events accurately, as provided by the HEART Score, would be crucial for the patient's management.

3. Given the focus on predicting major cardiac events and the patient's cardiac abnormalities and symptoms, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events.

2025-08-17 16:54:59,756 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

   - Function Docstring specifies the valid range of values for ekg_score as 0, 1, or 2.
     The provided value of 2 is within the valid range.

3. Parameter: age_score
   - Function Docstring specifies the valid range of values for age_score as 0, 1, or 2.
     The provided value of 2 is within the valid range.

4. Parameter: risk_factors_score
   - Function Docstring specifies the valid range of values for risk_factors_score as 0, 1, or 2.
     The provided value of 0 is within the valid range.

5. Parameter: troponin_score
   - Function Docstring specifies the valid range of values for troponin_score as 0, 1, or 2.
     The provided value of 2 is within the valid range.
