2025-08-17 16:55:14,016 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool that predicts the risk of major cardiac events in patients over the next 6 weeks. This aligns with the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events" from the Tool List as it specifically helps to risk-stratify patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome.

2. The Task Scenario provides information about the patient's diagnosis of rheumatic heart disease, including various valvular problems, arrhythmias, and cardiac issues. The patient also has low white blood cell and platelet counts, suggesting potential cardiac dysfunction. Given the focus on cardiac events and the patient's complex cardiac history, the HEART Score is the most suitable tool.

Based on the detailed analysis above, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List is "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events".

2025-08-17 16:55:23,718 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on the number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
