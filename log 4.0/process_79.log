2025-08-17 17:05:46,485 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool that assesses the pre-operative cardiac risk of a patient before knee internal fixation surgery.
2. The Task Scenario mentions issues related to a right patellar fracture, post-pacemaker conditions, knee pain, swelling, limited mobility, as well as cardiac concerns such as ventricular pacing, T-wave changes, left atrial enlargement, and impaired left ventricular diastolic function. Chronic viral hepatitis C, hypertension, and other chronic conditions are also mentioned.
3. Given the focus on pre-operative cardiac risk assessment in a patient with multiple cardiac issues and chronic diseases, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
4. This tool is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent non-cardiac surgery, based on specific risk factors which align with the cardiac issues mentioned in the scenario.
5. Therefore, the chosen tool aligns perfectly with the core keywords in the User Demand and addresses the cardiac concerns highlighted in the scenario.

2025-08-17 17:05:54,112 - INFO - {{{"Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
