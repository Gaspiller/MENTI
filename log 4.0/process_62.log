2025-08-17 16:59:41,428 - INFO - 1. The User Demand explicitly asks for a tool used to calculate Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).

2. Among the tools listed, the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator is designed specifically for calculating the mean arterial pressure of a patient based on their systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

3. Given the scenario provided, where the patient exhibits symptoms of a cardiac injury resulting in cardiac tamponade, the calculation of Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) becomes crucial to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. 

4. The symptoms mentioned in the scenario, such as altered mental status, restlessness, acute pain, and signs of cardiac tamponade on physical examination, all suggest compromised cardiac function requiring precise monitoring of Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).

5. Therefore, based on the alignment with the core medical intent of assessing cardiac function and perfusion in a patient with suspected cardiac injury, the most suitable tool from the list is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_tool_name": "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)"
}

    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333"}}

   Parameter List Unit: mmHg
   Comparison: The units match.
   
2. Parameter: diastolic_bp
