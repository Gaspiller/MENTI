2025-08-17 17:06:32,307 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifies the need for a tool to assess a patient's cardiac risk before undergoing a procedure known as "利凡诺穿刺引产" (amniocentesis), which involves extracting amniotic fluid for various diagnostic purposes during pregnancy.

2. Among the tools provided in the Tool List, the "Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)" is the most suitable choice for assessing cardiac risk in a perioperative setting.

3. The Gupta Perioperative Risk for MICA tool is designed to estimate the cardiac risk percentage for patients undergoing surgery based on various factors such as age, functional status, ASA class, creatinine level, and type of procedure being performed.

4. While the scenario does not explicitly mention the patient undergoing surgery, the need for assessing cardiac risk before a specific medical procedure aligns closely with the functionality of the Gupta Perioperative Risk for MICA tool, which covers the preoperative assessment of myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest risk.

5. Additionally, the concerns about cardiac risk assessment in the context of a pregnancy-related procedure like amniocentesis warrant using a tool specifically designed for perioperative cardiac risk evaluation.

6. Therefore, the "Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)" tool is the best choice based on the keywords "perioperative," "cardiac risk," and the nature of the medical procedure mentioned in the User Demand.
