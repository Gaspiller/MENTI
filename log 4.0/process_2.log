2025-08-17 16:38:51,140 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool to assess the risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) in surgical patients.
2. From the provided list of tools, the "Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)" is specifically designed to calculate the risk of VTE in surgical patients.
3. The detailed information for the Caprini Score tool mentions that it assesses the risk of VTE in surgical patients based on various risk factors and helps stratify patients for potential prophylactic interventions.
4. The parameters required by the Caprini Score tool align with the risk factors that are relevant in assessing the VTE risk in surgical patients, such as recent surgeries, immobilization with plaster cast, history of DVT or PE, and other thrombophilia factors.
5. Given that the case scenario involves a patient with a diagnosis of non-purulent thrombosis in cerebral venous sinus and the need to evaluate potential thrombosis risk factors beyond the diagnosed condition, the Caprini Score tool is the most suitable choice.
6. By selecting the Caprini Score tool, we can accurately assess the VTE risk in the surgical patient described in the case scenario based on the specific risk factors presented.
