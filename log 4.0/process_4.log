2025-08-17 16:39:47,051 - INFO - 1. User Demand: The user is asking for a tool used to evaluate the likelihood of streptococcal infection in children with pharyngitis. This aligns with the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis from the Tool List, as it is specifically designed to determine the probability of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis.

2. Task Scenario Analysis: Although the provided patient's case mentions pneumonia, neutropenia, and myocardial damage, the focus of the User Demand is on assessing the likelihood of streptococcal infection in children with pharyngitis. Therefore, the Centor Score is the most relevant tool in this context as it specifically targets the evaluation of streptococcal infection in patients presenting with pharyngitis symptoms.

Based on the User Demand and the Task Scenario, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List is the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.

2025-08-17 16:39:49,372 - INFO - {{"Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.
    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.
