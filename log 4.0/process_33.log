2025-08-17 16:49:54,413 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool to assess the patient's risk of developing coronary heart disease in the next 10 years. This aligns with the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease, as it specifically calculates the risk percentage of developing coronary heart disease and considers factors such as age, sex, smoking status, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.

2. The Task Scenario describes the patient's medical history and examination results, highlighting issues related to neurological function, including episodic altered consciousness, cerebrovascular lesions, and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. While these are important health concerns, they do not directly pertain to the risk assessment of coronary heart disease, which is the focus of the User Demand.

3. Given that the primary focus is on evaluating the risk of coronary heart disease, the most suitable tool from the provided list is the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease" as it directly addresses the specific request in the User Demand.

Parameters:
- age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
- sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
- smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
- total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
- hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
- systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
- bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

Returns:
float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
which may not fully align with current population risks."}}
