2025-08-17 17:09:12,879 - INFO - 1. The User Demand pertains to evaluating the risk of postoperative cardiac complications in a patient undergoing non-cardiac surgery. This aligns with the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" tool from the Tool List. This tool specifically calculates the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery.

2. The Task Scenario mentions a patient with congenital heart disease and other conditions undergoing non-cardiac surgery. Considering the patient's history of congenital heart disease with repair of a ventricular septal defect, assessing the risk of postoperative cardiac complications becomes crucial.

3. The "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" tool is designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. It factors in elements like history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and other relevant risk factors which are important in the context of the provided patient's case.

Based on this analysis, the most suitable tool for evaluating the patient's risk of postoperative cardiac complications following non-cardiac surgery is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk".

2025-08-17 17:09:19,218 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
