2025-08-17 16:48:58,953 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

    Parameters:
        age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.
        ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.
        platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).
        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.

Parameter List：
{"age": {"Value": 56, "Unit": "years"}, "ast": {"Value": 16, "Unit": "U/L"}, "platelets": {"Value": 207, "Unit": "x10^9/L"}, "alt": {"Value": 4, "Unit": "U/L"}}

Step By Step Analysis:
For parameter 'age':
Function Docstring Unit: years
Parameter List Unit: years
Decision: calculate

For parameter 'ast':
Function Docstring Unit: U/L
Parameter List Unit: U/L
Decision: calculate

For parameter 'platelets':
Function Docstring Unit: x10^9/L
Parameter List Unit: x10^9/L
Decision: calculate

For parameter 'alt':
