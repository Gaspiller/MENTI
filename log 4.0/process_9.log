2025-08-17 16:41:28,148 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess liver function and prognostic risk in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.
2. From the Tool List, the most suitable tool for this scenario is the "Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality."
3. The Child-Pugh Score is specifically designed for evaluating the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis, which aligns perfectly with the User Demand regarding the assessment of liver function and prognostic risk in alcoholic cirrhosis patients.
4. The parameters required for calculating the Child-Pugh Score include bilirubin level, albumin level, INR, presence of ascites, and grade of hepatic encephalopathy - all of which are pertinent in the scenario described.
5. Given the clinical case details of liver cirrhosis with symptoms of ascites, edema, jaundice, and abnormal liver function tests, the Child-Pugh Score can provide a comprehensive assessment of the severity of liver disease and prognosis in this patient.
6. Therefore, based on the user demand and the provided scenario, the most relevant and appropriate tool to choose is the "Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality."

    The Child-Pugh Score helps estimate the prognosis for a patient with cirrhosis.
    Note that newer scores like the MELD and MELD-Na are generally preferred for their
    increased accuracy in prognosis.

    Parameters:
    - bilirubin (float): Total bilirubin level in mg/dL.
    - albumin (float): Albumin level in g/dL.
    - inr (float): International Normalized Ratio.
    - ascites (str): Describes the presence of ascites ('Absent', 'Slight', 'Moderate').
    - encephalopathy (int): Grade of hepatic encephalopathy (0 for none, 1-2 for Grade 1-2, 3-4 for Grade 3-4).

    Returns:
    - int: The Child-Pugh Score, ranging from 5 (best) to 15 (worst)."}}

{{"bilirubin": {"Value": 31.3, "Unit": "mg/dL"}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
The parameter "bilirubin" has a value of 31.3 mg/dL, which complies with the requirements stated in the Function Docstring. No unit conversion is needed.
The unit of "bilirubin" matches with the required unit in the Function Docstring.
Next parameter analysis:
{{"albumin": {"Value": 3.12, "Unit": "g/dL"}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
The parameter "albumin" has a value of 3.12 g/dL, which complies with the requirements stated in the Function Docstring. No unit conversion is needed.
The unit of "albumin" matches with the required unit in the Function Docstring.
Next parameter analysis:
{{"inr": {"Value": 2.4, "Unit": null}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
The parameter "inr" has a value of 2.4, but the unit is not provided in the Parameter List. The Function Docstring does not specify the unit for INR, so the value seems to be correctly provided.
No unit conversion is needed for the "inr" parameter.
The unit of "inr" does not require specification according to the Function Docstring.
Next parameter analysis:
{{"ascites": {"Value": "Slight", "Unit": null}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
The parameter "ascites" with a value of "Slight" seems to be a categorical variable describing the presence of ascites, which complies with the requirements stated in the Function Docstring. No unit conversion is needed.
No unit requirements for the "ascites" parameter according to the Function Docstring.
Next parameter analysis:
{{"encephalopathy": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
The parameter "encephalopathy" has a value of 0, which indicates the Grade of hepatic encephalopathy as stated in the Function Docstring. There are no unit requirements specified for this parameter. No unit conversion is needed.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters match the required units or are categorical in nature."
