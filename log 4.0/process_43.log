2025-08-17 16:53:07,709 - INFO - Based on the User Demand and Task Scenario, which involve evaluating patients for upper gastrointestinal bleeding and determining the suitability for outpatient treatment, the most appropriate tool from the provided list is the "Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)." 

1. The User Demand specifically mentions the assessment of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding to determine if they are suitable for outpatient treatment. This aligns with the purpose of the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score, which is used to assess the severity of upper GI bleeding and aid in decision-making regarding hospital admission.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with gastrointestinal bleeding, black stools, and low hemoglobin levels, which are indicative of significant bleeding and potential complications. The Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score assesses parameters such as hemoglobin levels, blood urea nitrogen, blood pressure, and other clinical factors related to gastrointestinal bleeding severity.

3. The Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score is designed to help clinicians stratify patients based on the severity of upper GI bleeding, with higher scores indicating a greater risk and potential need for hospital admission. This scoring system is highly relevant for the presented case of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a patient with suspected gastric cancer and associated anemia.

Therefore, considering the core medical intent in the User Demand and the clinical details provided in the Task Scenario, the most suitable tool to choose from the list is the "Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)."

2025-08-17 16:53:14,267 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.
    
Parameters:
- hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
- bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
- systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
- sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
- heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is â‰¥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
- melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
- syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
- hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
- cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

Returns:
- int: Glasgow-Blatchford Score, ranging from 0 to 23.

This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.

Parameter List:
{{{"hemoglobin": {"Value": 6.7, "Unit": "g/dL"},
