2025-08-17 17:01:21,487 - INFO - 1. The User Demand requests the tool used to assess the severity of depression in patients.
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient presenting with symptoms of low mood, irritability, tearfulness, and headache, diagnosed with moderate to severe depression. The patient's emotional and social functioning is significantly affected, and treatment has stabilized the condition but ongoing therapy is required.
3. The symptoms detailed in the scenario (lowered interest or pleasure, feeling down, sleep issues, appetite issues, self-feeling) align with the criteria assessed by the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) tool, which is specifically designed to diagnose and quantify the severity of depression symptoms based on DSM criteria.
4. The PHQ-9 tool involves scoring each symptom on a scale from 0 to 3 and summing up these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.
5. Given that the scenario focuses on assessing and monitoring the severity of the patient's depression symptoms, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List is the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9).
6. By selecting the PHQ-9 tool, we can accurately evaluate and quantify the severity of the patient's depression symptoms, which aligns with the core keyword of "assessment of depression severity" in the User Demand.

2025-08-17 17:01:34,222 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.
