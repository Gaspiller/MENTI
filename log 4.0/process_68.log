2025-08-17 17:02:12,416 - INFO - 1. The User Demand mentions a "Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator" which can be used to calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

2. The Task Scenario involves monitoring the fetus's condition closely due to premature rupture of membranes, which can affect fetal development and growth. It emphasizes the importance of ensuring no related complications arise, indicating the need to track the pregnancy timeline and manage it effectively.

3. Given the main focus on pregnancy, estimation of due dates, and monitoring fetal health, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator."

2025-08-17 17:02:16,345 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

    This function uses a standard method recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),
    which considers the first trimester ultrasound measurements to be the most accurate method to establish gestational age.

    Parameters:
    - cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
                           If cycle_length is more than 28, the difference is added to the 40-week period.
    - last_menstrual_period (str): The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

    Returns:
    - str: The estimated due date in the format 'Day, Month DD, YYYY'.

    Usage:
    The function is intended for use by healthcare providers to estimate due dates for pregnant patients,
    which can help in managing pregnancy timelines effectively and in planning medical care accordingly.

    Example:
    'Monday, Oct 16, 2023'
}}
Parameter Listï¼š
{{{"cycle_length": {"Value": 28, "Unit": "day"}, "last_menstrual_period": {"Value": "2019/05/19", "Unit": "YYYY/MM/DD"}}}}
Step By Step Analysis:
1. Parameter: cycle_length
   Function Docstring: The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
   Parameter List: Value is 28 days.
   Comparison: The units are consistent.
   
2. Parameter: last_menstrual_period
   Function Docstring: The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.
   Parameter List: Value is "2019/05/19" (YYYY/MM/DD).
   Comparison: The units are consistent.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use indices to specify units."
