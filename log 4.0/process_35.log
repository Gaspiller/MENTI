2025-08-17 16:50:37,610 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms in adults, which directly matches the "GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7)" tool from the tool list.
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient presenting with symptoms of a manic episode with psychotic features, indicating emotional dysregulation and cognitive impairment. These symptoms are not specific to anxiety disorders but rather suggest a more severe psychiatric condition requiring medication and management of psychotic symptoms.
3. Since the primary focus is on assessing anxiety severity and the GAD-7 tool is specifically designed for this purpose, it aligns perfectly with the User Demand.
4. Considering the core keywords of "anxiety" and "severity" in the User Demand, the most suitable choice from the Tool List is the "GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7)" tool.

2025-08-17 16:50:44,451 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
    based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
    2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

    This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
    including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
    It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
    to assess and monitor treatment responses.

    Parameters:
    - nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
    - control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
    - worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
    - trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
    - restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
    - irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
    - fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

    Returns:
    int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

    Usage Example:
    gad_7_score = calculate_gad_7(3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
    print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score
