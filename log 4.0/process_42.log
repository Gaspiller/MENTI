2025-08-17 16:52:47,962 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifies a need for a tool used for risk assessment and stratification for patients with upper GI bleeding, which aligns with the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) tool from the provided list.
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with duodenal bulb ulcer and bleeding leading to iron-deficiency anemia, with symptoms like melena and positive fecal occult blood test. These symptoms directly relate to upper gastrointestinal bleeding, further reinforcing the suitability of the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score tool.
3. The Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) is specifically designed for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding, which matches the central theme of the User Demand and Task Scenario focusing on upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk assessment.
4. By utilizing the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) in this scenario, healthcare providers can effectively assess the patient's severity and need for hospitalization based on parameters such as hemoglobin levels, blood urea nitrogen, presence of melena, and other clinical factors associated with upper GI bleeding.
5. Therefore, the most suitable tool from the provided list for the User Demand and Task Scenario is the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS).

{{Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.
    
    Parameters:
    - hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
    - bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

    Returns:
    - int: Glasgow-Blatchford Score, ranging from 0 to 23.

    This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.
