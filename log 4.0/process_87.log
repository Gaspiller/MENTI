2025-08-17 17:08:49,573 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess the risk of cardiac complications after non-cardiac surgery.
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with a fractured right patella due to a knee injury and pre-existing cardiovascular issues such as aortic valve stenosis, mitral valve stenosis, reduced left ventricular function, and possible arrhythmias.
3. The cardiovascular issues mentioned in the patient's case align with heart-related complications that could arise post non-cardiac surgery.
4. The tool that best matches the User Demand and the Task Scenario is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
5. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, which directly relates to the scenario described.
6. Considering the patient's complex cardiovascular history and the potential impact of the surgery on cardiac health, using the Revised Cardiac Risk Index is essential for risk assessment.
7. Therefore, the most suitable tool for this scenario is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-17 17:08:56,947 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
