2025-08-17 17:02:51,648 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

This function uses a standard method recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),
which considers the first trimester ultrasound measurements to be the most accurate method to establish gestational age.

Parameters:
- cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
                       If cycle_length is more than 28, the difference is added to the 40-week period.
- last_menstrual_period (str): The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

Returns:
- str: The estimated due date in the format 'Day, Month DD, YYYY'.

Usage:
The function is intended for use by healthcare providers to estimate due dates for pregnant patients,
which can help in managing pregnancy timelines effectively and in planning medical care accordingly.

Example:
'Monday, Oct 16, 2023'

Parameter List:
{
    "cycle_length": {"Value": 28, "Unit": "days"},
    "last_menstrual_period": {"Value": "2018/03/15", "Unit": null}
}

Comparing cycle_length:
Parameter from Function Docstring: cycle_length (int) - The length of the menstrual cycle in days.
Parameter Value (from Parameter List): 28
Unit from Parameter List: days
Unit from Function Docstring: days
The units match.

Comparing last_menstrual_period:
Parameter from Function Docstring: last_menstrual_period (str) - The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.
Parameter Value (from Parameter List): "2018/03/15"
Unit from Parameter List: None
Unit from Function Docstring: Not applicable for string type parameters
The units match.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters are in the correct format."
}
