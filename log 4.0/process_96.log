2025-08-17 17:11:42,364 - INFO - 1. User Demand: The user is asking which tool is used to evaluate the cardiac risk of patients before surgery.

2. Task Scenario: The scenario describes a patient with acute drug poisoning, liver injury, abdominal effusion, and anemia. The clinical manifestations include dizziness, weakness, chest and abdominal pain with nausea and vomiting, moderate anemia, and evident local muscle tension tenderness, suggesting liver injury resulting in liver contusion, abdominal effusion, and anemia. Treatment shows improvement but requires close observation and further treatment.

3. Analysis:
   - The key medical aspect in the User Demand is assessing cardiac risk in preoperative patients.
   - The Task Scenario focuses on liver injury, abdominal effusion, and anemia rather than primarily cardiac issues.
   - From the Tool List, "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" is explicitly designed to assess cardiac risk in preoperative patients by considering specific risk factors related to cardiac complications.
   - This tool aligns closely with the core intent of the User Demand, addressing cardiac risk evaluation in a preoperative setting.

2025-08-17 17:11:47,439 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
