2025-08-17 16:52:11,743 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess a patient's level of consciousness and neurological function in the context of coma. This aligns with the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) from the Tool List, as the GCS is specifically designed to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are in a coma due to medical or surgical causes.

2. The provided Task Scenario describes a 55-year-old female farmer with sudden loss of consciousness, accompanied by a coma state. The physical examination reveals difficulty breathing, dilated pupils, loss of light reflex, and a GCS score of 4 (E1V1M2). These symptoms and findings are indicative of a possible intracerebral hemorrhage with hematoma formation, affecting the patient's neurological functions.

3. Given that the patient's condition involves coma, disruption of neurological function, and the need for assessment of consciousness level, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS).

Final Answer:

    "chosen_tool_name": "Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS)"

2025-08-17 16:52:17,040 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.}}
