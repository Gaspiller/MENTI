2025-08-17 16:42:28,339 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to calculate the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) of a patient, indicating a need for renal function assessment.
2. The Task Scenario provides details about a patient with symptoms and findings suggestive of glomerulonephritis, particularly IgA nephropathy, which can lead to impaired kidney function and manifestations like proteinuria and elevated serum creatinine.
3. Considering the core medical intent focused on renal function evaluation in a patient with possible glomerulonephritis, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)".
4. The CKD-EPI equation is specifically designed to estimate kidney function using creatinine-based equations, making it ideal for assessing GFR, especially in patients with chronic kidney disease like IgA nephropathy.
5. This tool aligns perfectly with the keywords of "Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)" and the focus on renal disease evaluation, making it the most appropriate choice for the given User Demand and Task Scenario.

2025-08-17 16:42:32,613 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

Parameters:
- serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
- age (int): The age of the patient in years.
- gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

Returns:
- float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

Usage:
To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

Note:
- Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
- Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.}}
