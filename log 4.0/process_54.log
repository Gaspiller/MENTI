2025-08-17 16:57:13,538 - INFO - Based on the User Demand "哪一个量表用于评估患者在未来6周发生重大心脏不良事件的风险？" (Which scale is used to assess the risk of major cardiac adverse events in patients in the next 6 weeks?), we need to choose a tool that specifically assesses the risk of major cardiac events. Among the tools provided in the Tool List, the most suitable tool for this scenario is the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events.

The HEART Score is designed to risk-stratify emergency department patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome. It takes into account various factors such as patient history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels to provide a total score that categorizes the risk of major cardiac events.

In the given Task Scenario, the patient has been diagnosed with acute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction, severe bradycardia due to third-degree atrioventricular block, and type 2 diabetes. These conditions suggest a significant cardiac burden and the need for ongoing monitoring of cardiac function. The HEART Score can assist in evaluating the patient's risk of major cardiac adverse events over the next 6 weeks.

Therefore, the most appropriate tool to use in this scenario is the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events.

2025-08-17 16:57:20,231 - INFO - 1. Parameter: history_score
Function Docstring:
{{history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.}}

Parameter List:
{{"history_score": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}}

Analysis:
The Function Docstring specifies that history_score should be an integer representing the suspicion level based on patient history. There is no unit involved in this parameter. The Parameter List provides a value of 1 for history_score, which is an integer as required. The units are already consistent.

2. Parameter: ekg_score
Function Docstring:
{{ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.}}

Parameter List:
{{"ekg_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null}}
    
Analysis:
The Function Docstring specifies that ekg_score should be an integer representing the EKG findings score. There is no unit involved in this parameter. The Parameter List provides a value of 2 for ekg_score, which is an integer as required. The units are consistent.

3. Parameter: age_score
Function Docstring:
{{age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.}}

Parameter List:
{{"age_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null}}
    
Analysis:
The Function Docstring specifies that age_score should be an integer representing the age score. There is no unit involved in this parameter. The Parameter List provides a value of 2 for age_score, which is an integer as required. The units are consistent.

4. Parameter: risk_factors_score
Function Docstring:
{{risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.}}

Parameter List:
{{"risk_factors_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null}}
    
Analysis:
The Function Docstring specifies that risk_factors_score should be an integer representing the risk factors score. There is no unit involved in this parameter. The Parameter List provides a value of 2 for risk_factors_score, which is an integer as required. The units are consistent.

5. Parameter: troponin_score
Function Docstring:
{{troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.}}

Parameter List:
{{"troponin_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null}}
    
Analysis:
The Function Docstring specifies that troponin_score should be an integer representing the troponin levels score. There is no unit involved in this parameter. The Parameter List provides a value of 2 for troponin_score, which is an integer as required. The units are consistent.

Final Answer:
