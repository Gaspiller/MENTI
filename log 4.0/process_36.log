2025-08-17 16:51:06,853 - INFO - {{"Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
    based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
    2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

    This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
    including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
    It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
    to assess and monitor treatment responses.

    Parameters:
    - nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
    - control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
    - worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
    - trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
    - restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
    - irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
    - fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

    Returns:
    int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

    Usage Example:
    gad_7_score = calculate_gad_7(3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
    print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score
