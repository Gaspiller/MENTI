2025-08-17 16:55:56,817 - INFO - 1. The user demand specifically asks for a tool used to predict the risk of major cardiac adverse events in patients following coronary angiography and left heart catheterization. This scenario indicates a need for a tool that assesses cardiac risk post-procedure.

2. From the provided tool list, the most suitable tool for this scenario would be the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events." This tool calculates the HEART Score based on patient history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels to stratify patients into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome.

3. Given the patient's history of myocardial ischemia, complaints of chest symptoms, and recent procedures involving the heart, the HEART Score can help in risk-stratifying the patient for major cardiac events post-coronary angiography and left heart catheterization.

2025-08-17 16:56:03,556 - INFO - {{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
