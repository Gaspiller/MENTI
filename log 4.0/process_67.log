2025-08-17 17:01:49,927 - INFO - 1. User Demand Analysis:
   - The user demands to know which scale is used to assess the severity of the patient's depression.
   - Key keywords: "depression severity" and "scale."

2. Tool List Assessment:
   - Looking at the Tool List, the most relevant tool for assessing the severity of depression is the "PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)".
   - The PHQ-9 is specifically designed to diagnose depression and quantify the severity of depressive symptoms based on a set of criteria.

3. Matching User Demand with Tool:
   - The User Demand directly asks for a scale to assess depression severity, which aligns perfectly with the purpose of the PHQ-9 tool.
   - The PHQ-9 evaluates symptoms related to depression and provides a total score that reflects the severity of the condition.
   - The symptoms described in the scenario, such as feeling down, anxious, trouble sleeping, and low energy, are all evaluated by the PHQ-9.

{{Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
- "0" for 'Not at all'
- "1" for 'Several days'
- "2" for 'More than half the days'
- "3" for 'Nearly every day'
The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

Parameters:
- interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
- feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
- sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
- tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
- appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
- self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
- concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
- activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
- suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

Returns:
- int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.
