2025-08-17 16:57:56,370 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to assess a patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).
2. The detailed Task Scenario provided mentions a patient diagnosed with pulmonary heart disease, heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and type II respiratory failure. The symptoms include dyspnea, wheezing, worsening after activity, no relief at rest, small amount of white sputum, crackles heard in the pharynx, inability to lie flat at night, abnormal blood gas analysis showing hypoxemia, hypercapnia, decreased oxygen saturation, elevated B-type natriuretic peptide, and echocardiogram indicating right heart overload.
3. Given the focus on assessing a patient's cardiovascular status and hemodynamic stability in the presence of complex cardiopulmonary issues, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator.
4. The MAP calculator is directly relevant to the user's query about assessing a patient's MAP and aligns perfectly with the core medical intent in the User Demand and the clinical scenario provided.
5. We will choose the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" tool from the Tool List as the most appropriate selection based on the User Demand and Task Scenario.

2025-08-17 16:57:59,669 - INFO - {{"Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.    
The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.

Parameters:
    systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.

Returns:
    float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.

Example:
    >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
    93.33333333333333}}

Parameter Listï¼š
{{{"systolic_bp": {"Value": 145, "Unit": "mmHg"}, "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 85, "Unit": "mmHg"}}}}
Step By Step Analysis: 
The systolic_bp is 145 mmHg which complies with the required unit of mmHg. 
The diastolic_bp is 85 mmHg which also complies with the required unit of mmHg.
Based on this analysis, all parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use mmHg to specify the units.
Final Answer:
