2. The Task Scenario provides details about the patient's condition, which involves drug-induced liver damage from the long-term use of Chinese medicine leading to symptoms of liver dysfunction.
3. Based on the keyword "drug-induced hepatitis" and the need to assess liver fibrosis in this specific case, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis".
4. The "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis" is designed to estimate the level of liver fibrosis without the need for invasive procedures like liver biopsy, making it appropriate for assessing liver damage in the context of drug-induced hepatitis.

2025-08-17 16:47:38,166 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

    Parameters:
        age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.
        ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.
        platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).
        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.

Parameter List:
{
    "age": {"Value": 36, "Unit": "岁"},
    "ast": {"Value": 560, "Unit": "U/L"},
    "platelets": {"Value": 190, "Unit": "× 10⁹/L"},
    "alt": {"Value": 890, "Unit": "U/L"}
