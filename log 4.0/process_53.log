2025-08-17 16:56:55,290 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool that predicts the risk of major cardiac events in heart patients over the next 6 weeks. The key evidence presented in the Task Scenario includes acute myocardial infarction with chest pain, EKG changes, elevated troponin I levels, and coronary artery calcification.

2. Based on the User Demand and Task Scenario keywords such as "major cardiac events" and "acute myocardial infarction," the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

3. The HEART Score is specifically designed to risk-stratify emergency department patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk categories for acute coronary syndrome, including acute myocardial infarction.

4. The parameters in the HEART Score calculation such as history assessment, EKG findings, troponin levels, and cardiovascular risk factors align closely with the presented case of acute myocardial infarction with associated risk factors like hypertension and diabetes.

Therefore, the most suitable tool based on the User Demand and Task Scenario is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-17 16:56:59,544 - INFO - {{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
