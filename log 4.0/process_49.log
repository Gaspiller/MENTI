2025-08-17 16:55:37,001 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to predict the risk of major cardiac events in patients within 6 weeks. This aligns with the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events" from the Tool List, as this tool specifically calculates the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) in emergency department patients with chest pain.

2. The Task Scenario describes a 54-year-old female patient with complete heart block (III-degree AV block) who has received a dual-chamber pacemaker implantation to stabilize her condition. While this scenario provides information about the patient's cardiac condition and treatment, it does not specifically mention any other risk factors that would point towards the use of other tools on the list.

3. Considering the core medical intent in the User Demand and the specific tool designed for predicting major cardiac events within a relevant timeframe, the most suitable tool to choose is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-17 16:55:44,687 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
