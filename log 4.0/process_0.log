2025-08-17 16:38:08,615 - INFO - 1. The core keywords in the User Demand are "ICU patient severity" and "predict mortality." This aligns with the APACHE II Score tool from the Tool List, as it is specifically designed to assess severity and predict mortality in ICU patients.

2. The Task Scenario mentions a subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), which can lead to neurological symptoms such as altered consciousness, aphasia, and sluggish pupillary light reflex. Additionally, there are indications of neurological, immune, and respiratory/circulatory system involvement. The APACHE II Score is relevant here as it considers parameters related to these systems, such as Glasgow Coma Scale, white blood cell count, and mean arterial pressure.

Based on the above analysis, the most suitable tool for evaluating the severity and predicting mortality in ICU patients, especially those with subarachnoid hemorrhage as in the provided case, is:
