2025-08-17 16:58:29,403 - INFO - 1. User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess a patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient exhibiting symptoms of mania, such as increased energy, decreased need for sleep, impulsivity, and irritability. The patient also shows symptoms of hyperthyroidism and has slightly elevated creatine kinase and glucose levels.
3. Considering the keywords "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" align with the demand, and the scenario does not explicitly mention depression or cardiac events, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator.
4. The "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" tool is directly related to assessing a patient's MAP, which is a crucial health metric used in various medical scenarios, including the assessment of tissue perfusion.
5. Thus, the most suitable tool based on the analysis is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator.

2025-08-17 16:58:33,249 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333}}

Parameter List：
{{{"systolic_bp": {"Value": 90, "Unit": "mmHg"}, "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 60, "Unit": "mmHg"}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:

For parameter 'systolic_bp':
Function Docstring:
systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.

Parameter List:
Value: 90
Unit: mmHg

Comparison:
The unit "mmHg" matches the requirement in the Function Docstring.

For parameter 'diastolic_bp':
Function Docstring:
diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.

Parameter List:
Value: 60
Unit: mmHg

Comparison:
The unit "mmHg" matches the requirement in the Function Docstring.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use the same units."
}
