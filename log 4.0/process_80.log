2025-08-17 17:06:07,532 - INFO - 1. "术前冠心病患者的术后心脏风险" indicates the evaluation of postoperative cardiac risk in patients with preoperative coronary heart disease. This aligns with the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" tool from the Tool List, as it specifically focuses on assessing the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

2. The scenario mentions "chronic atrophic gastritis with erosion, unstable angina, and previous history of ischemic heart disease." While there are multiple conditions mentioned, the presence of unstable angina and ischemic heart disease clearly highlights the cardiac aspect of the case. This further supports the choice of the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" tool as it is designed for assessing cardiac risk in preoperative patients.

3. Considering the patient's case with impaired cardiac function, it is crucial to evaluate the risk of postoperative cardiac complications to ensure appropriate monitoring and management. The "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" tool can provide valuable insights into the patient's cardiac risk profile and aid in decision-making regarding preoperative and postoperative care.

2025-08-17 17:06:19,102 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
