2025-08-17 17:02:30,052 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to estimate the patient's due date during pregnancy. This aligns with the "Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator" from the Tool List.
   
2. The Task Scenario mentions a patient who experienced fetal demise at 25+6 weeks gestation due to abnormal fetal heart structures, indicating potential cardiac functional abnormalities. While the scenario provides details about fetal anomalies, the core medical intent still revolves around pregnancy and due date estimation.

3. Given that the key focus remains on pregnancy and estimating the due date, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator."

2025-08-17 17:02:33,125 - INFO - {{"Calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

    This function uses a standard method recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),
    which considers the first trimester ultrasound measurements to be the most accurate method to establish gestational age.

    Parameters:
    - cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
                           If cycle_length is more than 28, the difference is added to the 40-week period.
    - last_menstrual_period (str): The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

    Returns:
    - str: The estimated due date in the format 'Day, Month DD, YYYY'.

    Usage:
    The function is intended for use by healthcare providers to estimate due dates for pregnant patients,
    which can help in managing pregnancy timelines effectively and in planning medical care accordingly.

    Example:
    'Monday, Oct 16, 2023'
}}

Parameter List：
{{{"cycle_length": {"Value": 28, "Unit": "days"}, "last_menstrual_period": {"Value": "2019/07/12", "Unit": null}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
Parameter 'cycle_length':
- Function Docstring specifies the parameter as an integer representing the length of the menstrual cycle in days.
- Parameter List shows the value as 28 days, which complies with the requirement in the Function Docstring.
- Units match, no unit conversion needed.

Parameter 'last_menstrual_period':
- Function Docstring specifies the parameter as a string in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format representing the first day of the last menstrual period.
- Parameter List shows the value as "2019/07/12", which is in the correct format as expected in the Function Docstring.
- Units are not applicable for a date value.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters do not involve units."
}
