2025-08-17 17:08:06,216 - INFO - 1. The user demand is asking for a tool to assess the preoperative risk of patients undergoing cardiac surgery. This aligns with the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" tool from the Tool List.

2. The provided case scenario describes a patient with Trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) detected through umbilical cord blood sampling and subsequent confirmation of the condition. The focus of the case is on the impact of Trisomy 21 on the patient's intellectual and physical development, as well as the delivery of a stillborn infant with potential complications related to Trisomy 21.

3. While the case involves genetic abnormalities and pregnancy outcomes, the core emphasis remains on cardiac surgery risk assessment, making the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index" the most suitable tool selection.

4. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, aligning with the evaluation needed for the patient's preoperative cardiac risk assessment prior to any potential surgical interventions.

2025-08-17 17:08:14,632 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
