2025-08-17 16:57:37,335 - INFO - 1. User Demand: The user is asking about a tool used to predict the risk of major cardiac events in a patient within 6 weeks.
2. Task Scenario: The patient has a primary diagnosis of coronary heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and narrowing of the cerebral arteries. The patient presents with episodic chest pain that can be relieved by sublingual medication, accompanied by shoulder and back discomfort. Imaging shows narrowing of the left posterior cerebral artery, indicative of cerebral artery atherosclerosis. Considering the clinical symptoms and test results, the patient may have coronary artery disease and cerebral artery atherosclerosis, which could lead to functional impairments in the heart and brain.
3. The keywords in the demand and scenario are related to predicting the risk of major cardiac events in a patient with cardiac and cerebral artery conditions.
4. Analyzing the tools in the tool list:
    - Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk: Focuses on assessing the risk of major cardiac complications in surgery, not specific to predicting events within a particular time frame.
    - HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events: Specifically designed to risk-stratify patients in the emergency department for acute coronary syndrome, matching the demand.
    - Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease: Estimates the risk of developing coronary heart disease based on various factors, not tailored for predicting major cardiac events within 6 weeks.
    - STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Assess obstructive sleep apnea risk, not directly relevant to predicting major cardiac events.
5. Based on the analysis, the most suitable tool matching the user demand and task scenario is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."
6. Final Answer:

2025-08-17 16:57:42,224 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

Step By Step Analysis:
For history_score:
Function Docstring states that it should be an integer without a specific unit. The provided Value for history_score is 1, which is an integer as required. The units are consistent.
For ekg_score:
Function Docstring states that it should be an integer without a specific unit. The provided Value for ekg_score is 0, which is an integer as required. The units are consistent.
For age_score:
Function Docstring states that it should be an integer without a specific unit. The provided Value for age_score is 1, which is an integer as required. The units are consistent.
For risk_factors_score:
Function Docstring states that it should be an integer without a specific unit. The provided Value for risk_factors_score is 2, which is an integer as required. The units are consistent.
For troponin_score:
Function Docstring states that it should be an integer without a specific unit. The provided Value for troponin_score is 0, which is an integer as required. The units are consistent.
