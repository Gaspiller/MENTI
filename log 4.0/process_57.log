2025-08-17 16:58:11,368 - INFO - 1. User Demand: The user is asking for a tool used to assess the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) of a patient.

2. Task Scenario Analysis:
   - The provided patient case involves multiple cardiac issues such as severe mitral valve stenosis and regurgitation, atrial fibrillation with multifocal premature ventricular contractions, and various symptoms indicating cardiac and respiratory impairment.
   - The focus of evaluation and management is on addressing the underlying rheumatic heart disease, managing atrial fibrillation, and optimizing heart function.

3. Alignment with Core Keywords:
   - Given the emphasis on assessing the patient's average arterial pressure (MAP) and the cardiac-related issues in the scenario, the ideal tool would be one that directly calculates the Mean Arterial Pressure. This aligns with the primary cardiovascular concerns and the need to monitor tissue perfusion and blood flow.

4. Selected Tool: Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)

{{"Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333}}

Parameter Listï¼š
{{{"systolic_bp": {"Value": 110, "Unit": "mmHg"}, "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 92, "Unit": "mmHg"}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
- Parameter 'systolic_bp':
    Function Docstring: Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    Parameter List: Value = 110, Unit = mmHg
    Comparison: Parameter complies with the Function Docstring requirements.

- Parameter 'diastolic_bp':
    Function Docstring: Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    Parameter List: Value = 92, Unit = mmHg
    Comparison: Parameter complies with the Function Docstring requirements.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use the same unit (mmHg)."
