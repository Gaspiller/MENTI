2025-08-17 16:59:58,642 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool to evaluate a patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (平均动脉压).
2. Among the tools provided in the Tool List, the tool that specifically calculates Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is the suitable choice for this task.
3. The description of the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) tool mentions that it calculates the mean arterial pressure from systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which aligns perfectly with the task of evaluating a patient's mean arterial pressure.
4. The Task Scenario describes a patient diagnosed with heart failure, left bundle branch block, and decreased left ventricular function, indicating potential issues with blood flow, heart load, and ultimately leading to heart failure symptoms. Monitoring Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is essential in such scenarios to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow.
5. Therefore, based on the alignment of the User Demand for evaluating Mean Arterial Pressure and the patient's medical scenario, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List is Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).

2025-08-17 17:00:00,597 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.

Parameters:
    systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.

Returns:
    float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.

Example:
    >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
    93.33333333333333

Parameter List:

    "systolic_bp": {"Value": 145, "Unit": "mmHg"},
