2025-08-17 16:54:33,161 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for the tool used to assess the risk of the patient developing myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest after surgery.
2. The key information in the Task Scenario is the diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which may affect thyroid hormone levels and overall metabolism.
3. Reviewing the Tool List, the most suitable tool for assessing the risk of major cardiac events postoperatively is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."
4. The HEART Score is specifically designed to risk-stratify patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which includes myocardial infarction.
5. Given the potential impact of altered metabolic function due to Hashimoto's thyroiditis on the cardiovascular system, the HEART Score is relevant for predicting the risk of cardiac events in this patient postoperatively.
6. Therefore, based on the alignment of keywords like "risk of myocardial infarction" and "postoperative cardiac events" in the User Demand and the intended purpose and relevance of the HEART Score in assessing cardiac risk, the most suitable tool to choose is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-17 16:54:37,318 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

Step By Step Analysis:

1. Parameter - age
Function Docstring: age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.

Parameter List Value: 52 years
Function Docstring Unit: years

Comparison:
Function Docstring requires the age in years, and the provided value complies with this unit. Therefore, no conversion is needed.

Final Answer:

    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use indices to specify units."
