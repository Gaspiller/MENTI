2025-08-17 16:43:23,914 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking which scale is used to evaluate a patient's glomerular filtration rate in Chinese.
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient diagnosed with stage 5 chronic kidney disease (CKD) with significantly elevated creatinine levels, presenting symptoms of fatigue, poor appetite, nausea, and vomiting, potentially indicating uremia due to kidney dysfunction. The patient also has comorbidities like hypertension, heart failure, anemia, and gastritis, likely secondary to CKD.
3. Given the focus on evaluating kidney function and the details of CKD and related complications in the patient, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be "CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)".
4. The CKD-EPI Equations for GFR are specifically designed to estimate kidney function using creatinine-based equations, making it directly relevant to assessing the glomerular filtration rate in patients with chronic kidney disease.
5. Therefore, based on the User Demand and the detailed information provided in the Task Scenario, the most appropriate tool to choose is the "CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)".

{{Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.
