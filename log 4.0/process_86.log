2025-08-17 17:08:29,368 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifies the need for a tool that evaluates the risk of postoperative cardiac complications in non-cardiac surgery patients.
2. Among the tools in the Tool List, the most relevant one for assessing the risk of postoperative cardiac complications in non-cardiac surgery patients is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
3. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery.
4. The Task Scenario mentions a patient with a primary issue of right inguinal hernia, which, if left untreated, could lead to complications that may impact normal intestinal function.
5. Surgery for repairing the inguinal hernia in such cases would involve a non-cardiac surgical procedure, aligning with the context of the User Demand and the use of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index.
6. Therefore, based on the alignment of the User Demand for assessing postoperative cardiac risks in non-cardiac surgery patients and the context of the Task Scenario involving surgery for inguinal hernia, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-17 17:08:35,494 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
