2025-08-17 16:49:34,238 - INFO - Based on the detailed analysis of the patient's condition provided in the Task Scenario, the tool that best aligns with the core keywords and medical intent involved in assessing the patient's 10-year risk of coronary artery atherosclerotic heart disease is the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease."

Here's the step-by-step analysis leading to this selection:

1. The patient presents with a series of cardiovascular risk factors and comorbidities, including severe uncontrolled hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, impaired left ventricular ejection fraction, valve regurgitation, dyslipidemia, and cardiac electrical disturbances. These factors collectively contribute to a high risk of coronary artery disease.

2. The Framingham Risk Score specifically assesses the risk of developing hard coronary heart disease by considering parameters such as age, sex, smoking status, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and medication use. This tool is designed for patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease history, diabetes, or intermittent claudication.

3. The Framingham Risk Score's focus on estimating the 10-year risk of developing coronary artery disease aligns perfectly with the long-term risk assessment requirement specified in the User Demand.

Therefore, considering the patient's complex cardiovascular profile and the need for a detailed evaluation of coronary artery disease risk over a 10-year period, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List is the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease."

{{ "Calculate the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease in patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease history, diabetes, or intermittent claudication.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
    - sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
    - total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    Returns:
    float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks."

Step By Step Analysis:
{{The age is 49 years. The age complies with the requirements of the Function Docstring. No unit conversion is needed as the parameter uses discrete units.

The sex is 1. The sex parameter complies with the requirements of the Function Docstring. No unit conversion is needed as the parameter uses discrete units.

The smoker_status is 1. The parameter meets the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameter uses discrete units.

The total_cholesterol is 320.92 mg/dL. The total_cholesterol complies with the requirements of the Function Docstring. No unit conversion is needed as the parameter uses the correct unit.

The hdl_cholesterol is 7.73 mg/dL. The hdl_cholesterol meets the requirements of the Function Docstring. No unit conversion is needed as the parameter uses the correct unit.

The systolic_bp is 160 mm Hg. The systolic_bp complies with the requirements of the Function Docstring. No unit conversion is needed as the parameter uses the correct unit.

The bp_medication is 1. The bp_medication parameter complies with the requirements of the Function Docstring. No unit conversion is needed as the parameter uses discrete units.
