2025-08-17 17:11:59,330 - INFO - 1. The User Demand explicitly asks for a tool to assess the severity of pneumonia in patients. This aligns perfectly with the PSI/PORT Score, which is specifically designed to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia, as mentioned in the Domain Mapping hints.

2. The Task Scenario provides additional information about the patient having pulmonary infection and bronchiectasis, indicating a respiratory condition. The abnormal BUN level suggests potential kidney dysfunction, which can be a contributing factor in pneumonia severity assessment.

3. Considering the core medical intent in the User Demand and the specific scenario of a patient with respiratory infection and potential renal dysfunction, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the PSI/PORT Score for Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP.

{{"Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
    It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    sex (str): Patient's sex, either 'Female' or 'Male'.
    nursing_home_resident (bool): True if the patient is a nursing home resident, False otherwise.
    neoplastic_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of neoplastic disease, False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of liver disease, False otherwise.
    chf_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, False otherwise.
    cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of cerebrovascular disease, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of renal disease, False otherwise.
    altered_mental_status (bool): True if the patient has altered mental status, False otherwise.
    respiratory_rate (bool): True if respiratory rate is ≥30 breaths/min, False otherwise.
    systolic_bp (bool): True if systolic blood pressure is <90 mmHg, False otherwise.
    temperature (bool): True if temperature is <35°C or >39.9°C, False otherwise.
    pulse (bool): True if pulse rate is ≥125 beats/min, False otherwise.
    blood_ph (bool): True if blood pH is <7.35, False otherwise.
    bun (bool): True if BUN is ≥30 mg/dL or ≥11 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    sodium (bool): True if sodium level is <130 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    glucose (bool): True if glucose level is ≥250 mg/dL or ≥14 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    hematocrit (bool): True if hematocrit is <30%, False otherwise.
    oxygen_pressure (bool): True if partial pressure of oxygen is <60 mmHg or <8 kPa, False otherwise.
    pleural_effusion (bool): True if there is pleural effusion on x-ray, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    int: The total PSI/PORT Score indicating the severity of the pneumonia."}}
