2025-08-17 16:56:37,083 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to predict the risk of cardiac events, especially for patients with congenital heart disease. This aligns with the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events" from the Tool List.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with congenital heart disease and various related complications affecting cardiac function, oxygen delivery, and circulatory system. The HEART Score is designed to risk-stratify patients presenting with chest pain, which can be a symptom of underlying cardiac issues in congenital heart disease patients.

3. Considering the patient's case and the specific demand for assessing cardiac event risk in congenital heart disease, the most suitable tool from the provided list is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-17 16:56:42,842 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculate the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
