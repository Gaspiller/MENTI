2025-08-17 16:56:18,136 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool that is used to predict the risk of major cardiac events in patients within 6 weeks. This aligns with the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events" tool from the Tool List.

2. The Task Scenario provides information about the patient's medical history and clinical presentation, highlighting issues such as dilated cardiomyopathy, heart failure, coronary artery disease, and exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. These conditions all involve potential cardiac complications, making the use of a tool like the HEART Score relevant for risk assessment in this case.

3. Given that the HEART Score is designed to risk-stratify emergency department patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome, it directly addresses the concerns raised in the Task Scenario related to potential major cardiac events in the patient.

Therefore, based on the alignment with the core medical intent in the User Demand and the relevance to the patient's clinical presentation in the Task Scenario, the most suitable tool to choose is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events".

2025-08-17 16:56:24,743 - INFO - {{"Calculate the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
