You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.}}

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. eye_response:
   - In the reference text, it is mentioned that the patient responds to painful stimuli and is able to make sounds. This indicates a motor response, but there is no clear indication of the eye or verbal response.
   - Based on the GCS scoring standards provided in the function docstring:
     * Eye responses are scored as follows: 4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none).
     * Verbal responses are scored as follows: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words), 2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response).
     * Motor responses are scored as follows: 6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain), 3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response).
   - Since there is no clear indication of the eye response in the reference text, we will infer it as 2 (to pain) based on the motor response mentioned.

2. verbal_response:
   - In the reference text, it is mentioned that the patient is able to make sounds, but there is no clear indication of the type of verbal response.
   - Based on the GCS scoring standards provided in the function docstring, we will infer the verbal response as 3 (inappropriate words) based on the ability to make sounds.

3. motor_response:
   - In the reference text, it is mentioned that the patient responds to painful stimuli by making sounds.
   - Based on the GCS scoring standards provided in the function docstring, the motor response can be inferred as 6 (obeys commands).

Parameters List:
```json
{
    "eye_response": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null},
