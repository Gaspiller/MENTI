You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的平均动脉压？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病例资料，患者被诊断为肺源性心脏病，该病导致右肺动脉增宽、右心室增大，右心负荷大，肺动脉高压等症状。主要症状包括憋气、喘气费力，咳嗽伴有少量白色粘痰，夜间难以平卧等。这可能引起心力衰竭和Ⅱ型呼吸衰竭，导致氧分压降低、二氧化碳分压升高、氧饱和度减低等。治疗方案中使用了利尿治疗、对症治疗等手段，病情好转。在治疗中可能需要继续监测肺动脉高压和心脏功能，以保证病情稳定。
