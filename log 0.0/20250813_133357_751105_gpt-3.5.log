You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者肺炎的严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

Based on the provided patient's case, the main abnormalities include cough with phlegm, nausea, vomiting, blood in the sputum, blurred consciousness, and reduced urine output. The chest CT shows lung infection with interstitial pneumonia. The elevated BUN levels indicate impaired kidney function.

Potential impairments to consider:
1. Respiratory function due to lung infection and pneumonia, leading to cough, sputum production, and difficulty breathing.
2. Renal function due to elevated BUN levels, indicating possible kidney impairment or dysfunction.
3. Cognitive function and consciousness due to blurred consciousness and dull expression, suggesting potential neurological involvement.

Further evaluation and treatment are necessary to address the underlying conditions affecting the respiratory, renal, and neurological functions of the patient.

    "Is there a specific scoring system for assessing the seriousness of pneumonia in patients?"
