[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于预测 6 周内患者发生重大心脏不良事件的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病例提供的信息，该患者出现了左心增大，左心室收缩及舒张功能减低，以及左室广泛前壁阶段性运动减低等异常表现。这可能导致心脏功能受损，包括心衰、心脏瓣膜功能异常等问题。此外，患者还出现了肺动脉高压和三尖瓣返流，这可能也会影响心脏功能和血液循环。治疗方案主要包括强心、利尿、扩血管、改善心功能等对症治疗，病情目前平稳。需要密切关注心衰等并发症的发展。
