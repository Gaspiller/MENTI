You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. interest_pleasure:
   - In the Reference Text, it mentions that the patient has been feeling down, depressed, and hopeless for 2 months. Given the severity of these symptoms, it is reasonable to infer that the patient is experiencing a lack of interest or pleasure in doing things.
   - Since the frequency is not explicitly stated but the severity is implied, we can assign a value of 2 to indicate 'More than half the days' from the Function Docstring for this parameter.
   
2. feeling_down:
   - It is explicitly mentioned in the Reference Text that the patient has been feeling down, depressed, and hopeless.
   - Given the severity of this symptom, we can assign a value of 3 to indicate 'Nearly every day' as per the Function Docstring.
   
3. sleep_issues:
   - The Reference Text indicates that the patient has been experiencing trouble falling or staying asleep for a month. This aligns with the sleep_issues parameter in the Function Docstring.
   - Since the frequency is not mentioned but the issue is there, we can assign a value of 2 to indicate 'More than half the days' from the Function Docstring.
   
4. tired_energy:
   - While the Reference Text does not explicitly state tiredness or lack of energy, based on the patient's depression symptoms, it is common for individuals to experience fatigue.
   - Considering this, we can assign a value of 2 to indicate 'More than half the days' as per the Function Docstring.
   
5. appetite_issues:
   - The Reference Text mentions appetite problems such as poor appetite.
   - Given this, we can assign a value of 2 to indicate 'More than half the days' for the appetite_issues parameter.
   
6. self_feeling:
   - The patient expresses feelings of being bad about oneself in the Reference Text.
   - We can assign a value of 2 to indicate 'More than half the days' for the self_feeling parameter.
   
7. concentration:
   - Although not directly mentioned in the Reference Text, the patient's difficulty in focusing and memory issues can be inferred from the depressive symptoms described.
   - Considering this, we can assign a value of 2 to indicate 'More than half the days' for the concentration parameter.
   
8. activity_level:
   - The Reference Text describes the patient's altered activity levels, where the patient stays at home all day and plays on the phone. This could indicate a change in activity level.
   - We can assign a value of 2 to indicate 'More than half the days' for the activity_level parameter.
   
9. suicidal_thoughts:
   - The patient denies having suicidal thoughts or wanting to die in the Reference Text.
   - Therefore, we can assign a value of 0 to indicate 'Not at all' for the suicidal_thoughts parameter.
