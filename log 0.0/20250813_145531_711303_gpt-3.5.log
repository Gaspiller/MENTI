[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于计算高血糖患者的实际钠水平？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和临床表现，可以推断患者可能患有类固醇性糖尿病。主要表现为口渴、多饮、多尿以及检查血糖明显升高。血糖检查结果显示持续升高，且尿液分析显示尿糖呈四加号（++++）阳性，进一步支持了糖尿病的诊断。

此外，患者的肾功能检查显示肌酐升高，尿检发现微量蛋白和尿蛋白阳性，提示肾功能可能存在异常。结合患者的既往史中发现“IgA肾病”，可以推断患者的肾功能可能受损，进一步加重了糖尿病的病情。

因此，患者可能存在糖尿病及肾功能异常，需要进一步内分泌科和肾脏科的治疗和管理。
