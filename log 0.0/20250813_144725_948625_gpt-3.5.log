You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications.
    This score helps predict the risk of pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery under general, neuraxial, or regional anesthesia.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    spo2 (int): Preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) percentage.
    respiratory_infection (int): Indicates the presence of respiratory infection in the last month. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
    anemia (int): Indicates preoperative anemia (Hgb ≤10 g/dL). 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
    surgical_incision (int): Type of surgical incision. 0 for 'Peripheral', 1 for 'Upper abdominal', 2 for 'Intrathoracic'.
    surgery_duration (int): Duration of the surgery in hours.
    emergency (int): Indicates if the procedure was an emergency. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.

    Returns:
    int: The ARISCAT score, which is a summation of points based on the provided parameters.

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Extracting age:
   - Reference Text: 79岁
   - Parameters from Function Docstring:
        - age (int): Patient's age in years.
   - Inference: The age is 79 years.

2. Extracting spo2:
   - Reference Text: Spo2 not mentioned in the text.
   - Parameters from Function Docstring:
        - spo2 (int): Preoperative oxygen saturation (SpO2) percentage.
   - Inference: Unable to determine the value of spo2 from the text. Assuming a random value.

3. Extracting respiratory_infection:
   - Reference Text: No mention of respiratory infection status.
   - Parameters from Function Docstring:
        - respiratory_infection (int): Indicates the presence of respiratory infection in the last month. 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
   - Inference: Since there is no mention of respiratory infection, assuming the value to be 0 for 'No'.

4. Extracting anemia:
   - Reference Text: No information provided about preoperative anemia.
   - Parameters from Function Docstring:
        - anemia (int): Indicates preoperative anemia (Hgb ≤10 g/dL). 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes'.
   - Inference: Since there is no information available, assuming the value to be 0 for 'No'.

5. Extracting surgical_incision:
   - Reference Text: No specific type of surgical incision mentioned.
   - Parameters from Function Docstring:
        - surgical_incision (int): Type of surgical incision. 0 for 'Peripheral', 1 for 'Upper abdominal', 2 for 'Intrathoracic'.
   - Inference: In the absence of specific information, assuming the value to be 0 for 'Peripheral'.

6. Extracting surgery_duration:
   - Reference Text: No mention of surgery duration.
   - Parameters from Function Docstring:
        - surgery_duration (int): Duration of the surgery in hours.
   - Inference: Unable to determine the duration from the text. Assuming a random value.
