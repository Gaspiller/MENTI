         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)

HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk: Calculate the HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.
    
    The HAS-BLED Score is used to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding and helps guide decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy.
    This scoring system can be considered alongside other bleeding risk scores or thromboembolic risk assessments to weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation.

MDRD GFR Equation: Calculate the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).
    This function estimates kidney function in patients with stable chronic kidney disease.
    It should not be used to assess acute renal failure or when GFR is >60 ml/min/m2 as it underestimates GFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_cr (float): Serum creatinine (Cr) level in mg/dL. Should be a positive float.
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years. Should be a non-negative integer.
    - race_index (int): Index representing the patient's race. 0 for non-black, 1 for black.
    - gender_index (int): Index representing the patient's gender. 0 for male, 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: Estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m2.

    The formula used:
    GFR = 175 × Serum Cr^{-1.154} × age^{-0.203} × 1.212 (if patient is black) × 0.742 (if female)


CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.


Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS): Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.
    
    Parameters:
    - hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
    - bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

    Returns:
    - int: Glasgow-Blatchford Score, ranging from 0 to 23.

    This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.


Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk: Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
