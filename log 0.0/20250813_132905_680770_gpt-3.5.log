You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的肾小球滤过率？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病例信息，患者被诊断为慢性肾衰竭CKD5期，即慢性肾病第五期，其肌酐、尿素氮和尿酸水平明显升高。慢性肾衰竭会导致肾功能受损，造成尿液清除能力下降，可能会出现乏力、纳差等症状。治疗方案中提到进行了血液透析，是为了帮助清除体内废物及维持体内的电解质平衡。

另外，患者还被诊断为高血压、心功能Ⅲ级、贫血和胃炎。这些疾病可能与慢性肾衰竭有关，因为肾脏功能下降可能导致高血压、水肿、贫血等并发症。

综上所述，患者的慢性肾衰竭是其病情的主要异常部分，可能导致肾功能受损并引起相关并发症影响身体的正常功能。
