[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于估计慢性肾炎患者的肾小球滤过率？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和体征，可以看出患者主诉的面部和双下肢水肿可能与慢性肾炎有关。检查显示肾功能异常，肌酐和尿酸升高，尿常规红细胞和白细胞增多，提示肾脏可能存在问题。此外，心脏彩超显示左室舒张功能减低，心肌酶谱测定异常，提示可能存在心脏问题。血液检查也显示白细胞比率异常。综合来看，患者可能存在肾脏和心脏功能受损的问题，需要进一步诊断和治疗。
