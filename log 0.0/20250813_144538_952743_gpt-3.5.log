You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. Your task is to transform the user's input search query into several similar queries, thereby helping the user to retrieve more useful information.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must be closely related to the input search query.
2. The generated queries must not alter the user's original intent.
3. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
4. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
5. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

Begin!

doctor input search query: The preop_treatment_with_insulin parameter value is missing. It needs to be assigned a boolean value in accordance with the Function Docstring requirements.

[output]  ```json
[
    "Assign a boolean value to the preop_treatment_with_insulin parameter following the Function Docstring requirements",
    "Ensure that the preop_treatment_with_insulin parameter has a boolean value as required by the Function Docstring",
    "The preop_treatment_with_insulin parameter value must be set to a boolean according to the Function Docstring specifications"
]
```
