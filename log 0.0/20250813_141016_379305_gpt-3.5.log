You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'APACHE II Score', 'Corrected QT Interval (QTc)', 'CIWA-Ar for Alcohol Withdrawal', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7)', 'HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance)', 'MDRD GFR Equation', 'Anion Gap', 'Ideal Body Weight and Adjusted Body Weight']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Calculate the STOP-BANG Score for screening Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

    This score is useful for patients undergoing preoperative evaluation but should not be used if a patient
    has already been diagnosed with OSA or uses CPAP at night. It helps in identifying patients who might have
    OSA and are at increased risk of perioperative cardiopulmonary complications, as well as other morbidity
    associated with OSA like daytime sleepiness and cardiopulmonary conditions.

    Parameters:
    - snore_loudly (bool): True if the patient snores loudly (louder than talking or loud enough to be heard through closed doors), False otherwise.
    - feel_tired_daytime (bool): True if the patient often feels tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime, False otherwise.
    - observed_apnea (bool): True if anyone has observed the patient stop breathing during sleep, False otherwise.
    - high_blood_pressure (bool): True if the patient has or is being treated for high blood pressure, False otherwise.
    - bmi (float): Body Mass Index of the patient.
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - neck_circumference (float): Neck circumference of the patient in centimeters.
    - gender (str): Gender of the patient. Expected values: 'Female' or 'Male'.

    Returns:
    int: The total STOP-BANG score, ranging from 0 to 8.

    Usage:
    >>> calculate_stop_bang_score(True, True, True, True, 36, 51, 41, 'Male')
    8

Corrected QT Interval (QTc): Calculate the Corrected QT Interval (QTc) for a patient.

    The QTc is used primarily to assess the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, especially torsades de pointes, 
    in patients with syncope or those receiving multiple QT-prolonging medications. A prolonged QT interval 
    can indicate a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This function corrects the QT interval to a heart rate 
    of 60 beats per minute, accounting for variations due to different heart rates.

    Parameters:
        qt_interval (float): The measured QT interval in milliseconds.
        heart_rate (float): The patient's heart rate in beats per minute.
        formula (str): The formula to use for correction. Options are 'Bazett', 'Fridericia', 
                       'Framingham', 'Hodges', and 'Rautaharju'.

    Returns:
        float: The corrected QT interval (QTc) in milliseconds.

    Example:
        >>> calculate_qtc(300, 70, 'Bazett')
        357.0

    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
    2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

    This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
    including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
    It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
    to assess and monitor treatment responses.

    Parameters:
    - nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
    - control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.

    print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score


HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance): Calculate the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).

    The HOMA-IR is a clinical tool used to estimate insulin resistance (IR), which can be
    indicative of potential glucose intolerance and diabetes. It is particularly useful
    in scenarios where more invasive and time-consuming methods like the clamp measurement
    (considered the gold standard for measuring IR) are not feasible. Although the HOMA-IR
    provides a reasonable correlation with clamp measurements, it is less accurate on an
    individual basis, which suggests a need for caution in its clinical application and
    interpretation.

    Parameters:
    - fasting_insulin (float): The fasting insulin level in uIU/mL.
    - fasting_glucose (float): The fasting glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR score).

    Formula:
    HOMA-IR score = (fasting insulin * fasting glucose) / 405

MDRD GFR Equation: Calculate the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).
    This function estimates kidney function in patients with stable chronic kidney disease.
    It should not be used to assess acute renal failure or when GFR is >60 ml/min/m2 as it underestimates GFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_cr (float): Serum creatinine (Cr) level in mg/dL. Should be a positive float.
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years. Should be a non-negative integer.
    - race_index (int): Index representing the patient's race. 0 for non-black, 1 for black.
    - gender_index (int): Index representing the patient's gender. 0 for male, 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: Estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m2.

    The formula used:
    GFR = 175 × Serum Cr^{-1.154} × age^{-0.203} × 1.212 (if patient is black) × 0.742 (if female)


Anion Gap: Calculate the Anion Gap using sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels.

    The Anion Gap is a measure used in medicine to help diagnose the presence of an acidosis and whether it has an elevated anion gap. This calculation is essential in identifying the type of acidosis a patient might have, differentiating between gap and non-gap acidoses. Elevated Anion Gap suggests the presence of additional unmeasured anions in the blood, which could indicate conditions like ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or poisoning by substances such as methanol.

    Parameters:
    sodium (float): Sodium level in mEq/L.
    chloride (float): Chloride level in mEq/L.
    bicarbonate (float): Bicarbonate level in mEq/L.

    Returns:
    float: The calculated Anion Gap in mEq/L.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_anion_gap(140, 104, 24)
    12.0
 

Ideal Body Weight and Adjusted Body Weight: Calculate the Ideal Body Weight (IBW) and Adjusted Body Weight (ABW) based on height and gender.
    
    The IBW calculation uses the Devine formula, which is applicable for individuals who are at least 60 inches tall.
    For individuals shorter than 5 feet, the IBW is adjusted by subtracting 2-5 lbs for each inch below 60 inches.
    The ABW is used for obese patients where the actual body weight exceeds the IBW, calculated as:
    ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (actual body weight - IBW).
    
    Parameters:
        height_in_inches (int): The height of the individual in inches.
        actual_body_weight (float): The actual body weight of the individual in kilograms.
        gender (str): The gender of the individual ("male" or "female").

    Returns:
        list: A list containing the IBW and ABW in kilograms. If the individual is not obese, ABW is set equal to IBW.

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. The user demand indicates an issue with the input values for a specific tool.
2. Based on the provided information, the tool in question seems to be the CIWA-Ar for Alcohol Withdrawal.
3. The CIWA-Ar tool requires input values within specific ranges for various symptoms related to alcohol withdrawal.
4. The error suggests that the 'loc_alertness' value provided is outside the allowed range [0, 2].
5. To address this issue, the input for 'loc_alertness' needs to be adjusted to fall within the range [0, 2].
6. Once the input values are corrected, the CIWA-Ar tool can be used to calculate the severity score for alcohol withdrawal symptoms.
