[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估该患者肺炎的严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和检查结果显示，患者同时患有支气管炎和中性粒细胞减少症。中性粒细胞减少可能导致免疫功能下降，增加感染的风险。治疗方案包括联合抗感染和地榆升白片，这提示可能存在细菌感染导致的身体抵抗力下降。在治疗后症状有所缓解，但仍存在喘息和偶发咳嗽，可能需要进一步关注和调整治疗方案以控制病情。
