2. The task scenario involves a patient with a confirmed case of 21-trisomy syndrome in the fetus and the decision to induce labor due to the high-risk factor associated with this genetic condition.
3. Given the scenario, the tool that best fits the user demand is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
4. This tool is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent non-cardiac surgery, which aligns with the need to evaluate cardiac risk in the context of the patient's impending labor induction procedure.

   - There is no clear indication in the Reference Text whether the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular. Therefore, we will assume this parameter is False.
   - Value: False

2. history_of_ischemic_heart_disease:
   - There is no mention of a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy in the Reference Text. Therefore, we will assume this parameter is False.

3. history_of_congestive_heart_failure:
   - There is no mention of signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution in the Reference Text. Therefore, we will assume this parameter is False.

4. history_of_cerebrovascular_disease:
   - There is no mention of a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke in the Reference Text. Therefore, we will assume this parameter is False.

5. preop_treatment_with_insulin:
   - The Reference Text mentions "术前未使用胰岛素治疗" which translates to "preop not using insulin treatment." Therefore, we will assume this parameter is False.

2025-08-13 14:48:04,102 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
