[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于术前评估患者的心脏风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和检查结果显示，患者是一名怀孕39周的孕妇，主诉规则腹痛。经过检查发现胎儿大小为3400g，胎方位LOA，宫颈已经开始消退，但宫颈扩张仍为0cm，胎膜未破。二维彩超显示胎儿健康状况良好，胎盘位于前壁。

根据以上情况可以推断，患者可能有一种称为盆腔不全的病情，即宫颈没有开始扩张，可能会导致分娩的困难和并发症。需要密切监测患者的情况，必要时可能需要进行干预措施来促进宫颈扩张以顺利进行分娩。
