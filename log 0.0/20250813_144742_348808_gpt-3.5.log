You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估手术前患者的心脏手术后风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:
1. The patient presented with a history of a positive urine HCG test after a 40-day menstrual delay, indicating a possible pregnancy. This was further confirmed by the presence of fetal movement and a positive result for 21-trisomy syndrome in the umbilical cord blood test.
2. The decision to induce labor was made due to the high-risk factor of 21-trisomy syndrome in the fetus.
3. The patient did not report any significant abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, headaches, dizziness, or other alarming symptoms during the pregnancy period.
4. The patient denied a history of chronic diseases, surgeries, traumas, or blood transfusions.

Impaired bodily functions:
Based on the provided information, the main impairment could be in the genetic makeup of the fetus, leading to the diagnosis of 21-trisomy syndrome. This condition results from the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21, leading to developmental delays and physical abnormalities. The decision to induce labor was likely made to address the complications associated with this genetic anomaly.

    "What assessment tool is recommended for evaluating the risk of heart surgery after the procedure for patients with genetic disorders like 21-trisomy syndrome?",
    "Is there a specific scoring system utilized to evaluate the postoperative risk of heart surgery in patients, especially those with genetic conditions like 21-trisomy syndrome?"
