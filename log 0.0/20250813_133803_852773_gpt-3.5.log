You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估本例患者药物性肝炎引起的肝纤维化程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病历信息，患者长期服用壮腰健肾丸导致药物性肝损伤。这表现为皮肤黄染、乏力、腹胀等症状，以及肝功能检查异常，包括高总胆红素、直接胆红素、间接胆红素、谷丙转氨酶和谷草转氨酶水平。这些指标的升高表明肝功能受损，可能影响肝脏的代谢和解毒功能。治疗方案中停用壮腰健肾丸，对症治疗也证实了药物性肝损伤的诊断。因此，患者的肝功能受损，可能导致代谢和解毒功能减弱。
