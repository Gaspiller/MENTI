You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis', 'Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality', 'Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP', 'CIWA-Ar for Alcohol Withdrawal', 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'MELD Na (UNOS/OPTN)']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

    Parameters:
        age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.
        ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.
        platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).
        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.


Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality: Calculate the Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality.

    The Child-Pugh Score helps estimate the prognosis for a patient with cirrhosis.
    Note that newer scores like the MELD and MELD-Na are generally preferred for their
    increased accuracy in prognosis.

    Parameters:
    - bilirubin (float): Total bilirubin level in mg/dL.
    - albumin (float): Albumin level in g/dL.
    - inr (float): International Normalized Ratio.
    - ascites (str): Describes the presence of ascites ('Absent', 'Slight', 'Moderate').
    - encephalopathy (int): Grade of hepatic encephalopathy (0 for none, 1-2 for Grade 1-2, 3-4 for Grade 3-4).

    Returns:
    - int: The Child-Pugh Score, ranging from 5 (best) to 15 (worst).

Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.
    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.
 

Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score: "Calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score which is used to assess the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表用于评估肝硬化患者的肝功能和疾病严重程度？}}
Task Scenario: {{Based on the patient's case, the main abnormalities include liver cirrhosis, splenomegaly, hyperthyroidism (Graves' disease), heart failure with Class IV, pneumonia in both lungs, and bilateral pleural effusion. The liver function tests showed elevated levels of AST, GGT, cholinesterase, and bilirubin. The thyroid function tests indicate hyperthyroidism with low TSH, high FT3 and FT4 levels, and positive thyroid antibodies. The ultrasound results also confirm the enlarged thyroid gland with increased blood flow. The heart ultrasound shows an enlarged heart with a reduced ejection fraction, severe tricuspid regurgitation, and mild mitral regurgitation. The patient's CT scan shows signs of liver cirrhosis, splenomegaly, ascites, and bilateral pleural effusion.

Possible impaired bodily functions include liver function due to liver cirrhosis, thyroid function due to hyperthyroidism, heart function due to heart failure, and pulmonary function due to pneumonia and pleural effusion. Additional health monitoring and treatment may be required to manage these conditions effectively.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. The user demand is to identify a tool used to assess liver function and the severity of liver disease in patients with liver cirrhosis. 

2. The task scenario describes a patient with liver cirrhosis, along with other complications such as splenomegaly, hyperthyroidism, heart failure, pneumonia, and bilateral pleural effusion. The patient shows elevated liver function test results and imaging findings consistent with cirrhosis.

3. Given the focus on assessing liver function and disease severity in a patient with liver cirrhosis, the most suitable tool from the tool list is the "Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality."

4. The Child-Pugh Score is specifically designed to estimate the prognosis and severity of disease in patients with cirrhosis. It takes into account factors such as bilirubin levels, albumin levels, INR, presence of ascites, and grade of hepatic encephalopathy.

5. By calculating the Child-Pugh Score for the patient in the task scenario, healthcare providers can better understand the severity of the liver disease, prognosticate the patient's outcome, and guide treatment decisions accordingly.
