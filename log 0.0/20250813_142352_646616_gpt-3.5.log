[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的平均动脉压（MAP）？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病例资料，患者主要病情为风湿性心脏病，表现为胸闷、气短加重，伴有咳嗽、咳痰、头晕、纳差、剑下疼痛等症状。辅助检查显示心电图出现心房颤动和频发多源性室性早搏，心脏彩超显示重度二尖瓣狭窄并反流。这些结果表明患者的心脏功能受损，可能导致心脏的泵血功能减弱，血液循环受阻，甚至可能出现心力衰竭等问题。治疗方案中强调予利尿减轻心脏负荷、改善心功能等措施也印证了这一点。需要密切关注患者心脏功能的恢复和控制，以改善预后和循环系统的问题。
