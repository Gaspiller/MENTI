    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.

Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.

    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Based on the user demand, the tool that is used to evaluate the severity of liver fibrosis in cirrhotic patients and assess liver transplant candidacy is the "Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality."

2. The "Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality" is a scoring system that estimates the prognosis for a patient with cirrhosis, taking into account parameters such as bilirubin levels, albumin levels, international normalized ratio (INR), presence of ascites, and grade of hepatic encephalopathy.

3. Given the user's scenario of a patient with hepatitis B-related cirrhosis (decompensated phase) and late-stage hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), presenting with abnormal blood counts, elevated liver function tests, and signs of compromised liver function on imaging, the "Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality" is appropriate.

4. The presence of complications like upper gastrointestinal bleeding suggests the need for tailored treatment to protect organ function, making the assessment of liver function using the "Child-Pugh Score" critical in this case.
