You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估该患者抑郁症的严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:
The patient's case highlights severe depressive symptoms without psychotic features, including a persistent low mood, sleep disturbances, excessive worrying, feelings of guilt, suicidal ideation, and motor abnormalities like repetitive head movements and limb stiffness. The patient's refusal of treatment, lack of insight into her condition, and delusional beliefs suggest impaired judgment and insight. The MRI findings indicating slight degenerative changes in the bilateral frontal lobes and inflammation in the sinuses may contribute to cognitive and emotional disturbances. The patient's history of flood-related stressors and financial concerns also likely exacerbate her depressive symptoms. The treatment regimen with antidepressants and supportive therapies has led to improvement in the patient's condition.
