[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者在高风险手术前的心脏风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和辅助检查结果，患者被诊断为前置胎盘伴出血。前置胎盘是指胎盘定位在子宫的前壁，可能会导致阴道出血和胎儿发育受限。在这种情况下，患者可能出现少量阴道出血，此外还可能存在胎儿发育受限的风险。需要密切监测患者的病情，以确保母婴安全。
