    Usage:
    This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.
    
    Example:
    >>> curb_65_score(1, 1, 1, 0, 1)
    4
   

Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.

    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表被用于评估该患者术后风险？}}
Task Scenario: {{Based on the provided patient's case, the main abnormal parts include a 79-year-old male retiree presenting with a 10-month history of cough and back pain, with worsening symptoms leading to hospitalization. The chest CT revealed lung cancer with metastasis to the 6th thoracic vertebra. The patient has been receiving symptomatic treatment for the condition.

Given the presence of lung cancer and metastasis to the spine, the patient may be experiencing impaired respiratory function due to the lung cancer affecting lung capacity and function. The back pain could also suggest potential spinal cord compression or nerve involvement from the metastasis, leading to symptoms such as pain and potentially impaired mobility. Additional monitoring and interventions may be required to address these potential impairments.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Based on the provided patient's case, the main focus is on assessing the patient's postoperative risk. The patient is a 79-year-old male retiree with lung cancer and metastasis to the spine, presenting with symptoms of cough and back pain. This scenario requires evaluating the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications due to the underlying lung cancer and potential spinal cord involvement.

2. The most suitable tool from the tool list to assess the postoperative risk in this patient scenario is the "ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications." This tool specifically helps predict the risk of pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery under different types of anesthesia, which aligns with the need to evaluate the postoperative risk in the case of the patient with lung cancer and spinal metastasis.

3. By utilizing the ARISCAT Score tool, healthcare providers can input the relevant parameters such as the patient's age, preoperative oxygen saturation, presence of respiratory infection, anemia, surgical incision type, surgery duration, and emergency procedure status to calculate the ARISCAT score.

4. The calculated ARISCAT score will provide a summation of points based on the patient's specific parameters, giving an indication of the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications in this case.
