[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于计算高血糖患者的实际钠水平？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和辅助检查结果，可以推断患者患有糖尿病并发症，主要表现为多饮、多尿、口渴、双下肢麻木刺痛，尿常规显示葡萄糖高，血糖和糖化血红蛋白均升高，且血钠水平较高。这可能导致患者出现神经功能异常，特别是双下肢神经受损，表现为麻木刺痛和触觉迟钝。需进一步检查和治疗以防止病情进展和并发症的发生。
