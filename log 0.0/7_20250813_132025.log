2025-08-13 13:20:39,671 - INFO - 1. User Demand: The user is asking which tool is used to assess the stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.

2. Task Scenario: The provided patient's case involves a history of migratory joint pain, swelling, fatigue, rheumatic heart disease with mitral stenosis, and symptoms suggestive of heart impairment. The focus is on evaluating the stroke risk in atrial fibrillation.

3. Analysis: The most suitable tool for assessing stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation in this scenario would be the "CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk." This tool is specifically designed to estimate the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation based on various risk factors, including age, sex, and medical history.

2025-08-13 13:20:43,490 - INFO - 1. Age:
   - The patient is 46 years old.
   - Therefore, the age parameter is 46.

2. Sex:
   - The patient is female.

3. History of Congestive Heart Failure:
   - The reference text does not explicitly mention a history of congestive heart failure.
   - Since there is no indication of congestive heart failure in the text, assume it as False.
   - Therefore, the history_of_congestive_heart_failure parameter is False.

4. History of Hypertension:
   - The reference text does not mention a history of hypertension.
   - Since there is no indication of hypertension in the text, assume it as False.
   - Therefore, the history_of_hypertension parameter is False.

5. History of Stroke/TIA/Thromboembolism:
   - The reference text does mention a history of stroke in the past.
   - Therefore, the history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism parameter is True.

6. History of Vascular Disease:
   - The reference text does not explicitly mention a history of vascular disease.
   - Since there is no indication of vascular disease in the text, assume it as False.
   - Therefore, the history_of_vascular_disease parameter is False.

7. History of Diabetes:
   - The reference text explicitly states that the patient has no history of diabetes.
   - Therefore, the history_of_diabetes parameter is False.

2025-08-13 13:20:55,799 - INFO - {{"Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

Parameters:
- age (int): Age of the patient.
- sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
- history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
- history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
- history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
- history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
- history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

Returns:
- int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

Example:
>>> calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(75, 'female', True, True, True, True, True)
