You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估患者的平均动脉压（MAP）？

Patient Case Analysis:

 分析与推测：

根据患者病史和临床表现，可以推断患者可能存在胆总管结石伴急性化脓性胆管炎的情况。这是由于患者术后多次出现感染症状，以及病情平稳后突然出现上腹部疼痛、呕吐、发热等急性症状。辅助检查结果显示白细胞增高、CRP升高等指标，进一步支持了急性感染的可能性。此外，彩超和CT结果显示胆总管结石、胆总管扩张等结构异常，也与胆总管感染的诊断相符。

因此，可以推测患者胆总管结石伴急性化脓性胆管炎可能导致了脓毒血症和局限性腹膜炎等并发症，需要及时处理感染并进一步考虑手术治疗。
