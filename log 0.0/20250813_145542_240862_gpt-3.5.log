You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA)', 'CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'MDRD GFR Equation', 'Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity', 'Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation)', 'Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis', 'Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia', 'Ideal Body Weight and Adjusted Body Weight', 'Free Water Deficit in Hypernatremia']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA): Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA) using provided weight and height.

    BMI is a measure of body fat based on weight and height that applies to adult men and women.
    It can be misleading for very muscular individuals or in specific ethnic groups with different
    body compositions and statures.

    BSA is often used in medical settings to determine the dosages of medications that are more 
    accurately calculated using body surface area rather than weight.

    Parameters:
    - weight_kg (float): Weight of the individual in kilograms.
    - height_cm (float): Height of the individual in centimeters.

    Returns:
    - dict: Dictionary containing 'BMI' and 'BSA' with their respective values.

CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.


Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score: "Calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score which is used to assess the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.
The score is used to track a patient's status during their stay in an intensive care unit to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.

Parameters:
- pao2_fio2_ratio (float): The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (mmHg).
- platelets (float): Platelet count in ×103/µL.
- glasgow_coma_scale (int): Score on the Glasgow Coma Scale.
- bilirubin (float): Serum bilirubin in mg/dL.
- map_pressure (float): Mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
- vasoactive_agents (int): Index indicating the vasoactive agents being used. Corresponds to 0 for no agents, 1 for low dose dopamine or any dose dobutamine, 2 for higher dose dopamine or low dose epinephrine/norepinephrine, 3 for very high dose of these agents.
- creatinine (float): Serum creatinine in mg/dL.
- urine_output (float): Urine output in mL/day.
- o2_delivery_type (int): Index of the type of oxygen delivery method used. Types are as follows: 0 = nasal cannula, 1 = simple face mask, 2 = non-rebreather mask, 3 = high-flow nasal cannula.
- o2_flow_rate (float): Flow rate of oxygen delivery in L/min.

Returns:
int: Total SOFA score which is the sum of individual scores across the specified parameters."

MDRD GFR Equation: Calculate the Modified Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).
    This function estimates kidney function in patients with stable chronic kidney disease.
    It should not be used to assess acute renal failure or when GFR is >60 ml/min/m2 as it underestimates GFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_cr (float): Serum creatinine (Cr) level in mg/dL. Should be a positive float.
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years. Should be a non-negative integer.
    - race_index (int): Index representing the patient's race. 0 for non-black, 1 for black.
    - gender_index (int): Index representing the patient's gender. 0 for male, 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: Estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m2.

    The formula used:
    GFR = 175 × Serum Cr^{-1.154} × age^{-0.203} × 1.212 (if patient is black) × 0.742 (if female)


Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity: Calculate the Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity using the Smithline-Gardner Formula.

    This function calculates the serum osmolality/osmolarity based on the concentrations of sodium, glucose,
    and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the blood. Serum osmolality is a measure of the solute concentration in the blood,
    and it can be used to assess the body's fluid and electrolyte balance. An osmolar gap (difference between measured
    and expected osmolality) greater than 10 can indicate the presence of certain toxic alcohols, mannitol, or propylene glycol.

    Note: At extreme levels of serum glucose, such as in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), the osmolar gap may be skewed,
    and clinical judgment should be used.

    Parameters:
    serum_na (float): Serum sodium concentration in mmol/L. Typical reference range is 135-145 mmol/L.
    serum_glucose (float): Serum glucose concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 70-100 mg/dL.
    serum_bun (float): Blood urea nitrogen concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 7-20 mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: Calculated serum osmolality in mOsm/kg.

    Formula:
    Serum Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 2 * (serum_na) + (serum_glucose / 18) + (serum_bun / 2.8)


Creatinine Clearance (Cockcroft-Gault Equation): 
    Calculate the Creatinine Clearance using the Cockcroft-Gault Equation.

    This function estimates kidney function, useful for Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) staging
    and adjusting or discontinuing medications based on kidney function. It incorporates
    the patient's age, weight, sex, and serum creatinine levels to calculate the clearance rate.
    This is particularly relevant when considering medication dosages for patients with reduced
    kidney function, despite potential overestimations in GFR with newer creatinine assays.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Should be a positive integer.
    - weight (float): The weight of the patient in kilograms. Should be a positive decimal.
    - creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level in mg/dL. Should be a positive decimal.
    - sex (str): The sex of the patient. Acceptable values are 'male' or 'female'.
                 This affects the calculation as there is a different multiplier for females.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated creatinine clearance in mL/min.
    
    Example:
    >>> calculate_creatinine_clearance(50, 70, 1.2, 'female')
    49.30555555555556
  

Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

    Parameters:
        age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.
        ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.
        platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).
        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.


Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia: Calculate the corrected calcium level in patients with suspected hypocalcemia
    who have low albumin levels. Hypocalcemia might not be apparent if serum albumin is low,
    thus this formula adjusts the calcium level based on albumin discrepancy.

    Args:
    normal_albumin (float): The normal albumin level in g/dL assumed for the calculation.
    patient_albumin (float): The patient's measured albumin level in g/dL.
    serum_ca (float): The patient's measured serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: The corrected serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Example:
    >>> corrected_calcium(4.0, 3.2, 8.5)
    8.84
 

Ideal Body Weight and Adjusted Body Weight: Calculate the Ideal Body Weight (IBW) and Adjusted Body Weight (ABW) based on height and gender.
    
    The IBW calculation uses the Devine formula, which is applicable for individuals who are at least 60 inches tall.
    For individuals shorter than 5 feet, the IBW is adjusted by subtracting 2-5 lbs for each inch below 60 inches.
    The ABW is used for obese patients where the actual body weight exceeds the IBW, calculated as:
    ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (actual body weight - IBW).
    
    Parameters:
        height_in_inches (int): The height of the individual in inches.
        actual_body_weight (float): The actual body weight of the individual in kilograms.
        gender (str): The gender of the individual ("male" or "female").

    Returns:
        list: A list containing the IBW and ABW in kilograms. If the individual is not obese, ABW is set equal to IBW.

Free Water Deficit in Hypernatremia: Calculate the Free Water Deficit (FWD) in a patient with hypernatremia.

    The FWD is a measure used in the management of hypernatremia to determine the amount
    of water a patient needs to ingest or be given intravenously to reach normal serum
    sodium levels without inducing cellular edema.

    Parameters:
    - gender_age_group (int): Index representing the patient's gender and age group.
      - 0: Adult male
      - 1: Adult female
      - 2: Elderly male
      - 3: Elderly female
      - 4: Child
    - weight_kg (float): The weight of the patient in kilograms.
    - current_na (float): The current serum sodium level of the patient (mmol/L).
    - ideal_na (float): The target or ideal serum sodium level for the patient (mmol/L).

    Returns:
    - float: The calculated free water deficit in liters.

    Usage:
    Calculate the free water deficit for an elderly female weighing 70 kg with a current
    sodium level of 155 mmol/L and an ideal sodium level of 140 mmol/L:
    >>> calculate_free_water_deficit(3, 70, 155, 140)
