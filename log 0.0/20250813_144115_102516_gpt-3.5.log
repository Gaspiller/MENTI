[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估该患者社区获得性肺炎的严重程度指数？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和辅助检查结果，可以初步推断患者可能患有肺部感染。体征包括咳嗽、咳痰，发热，胸部CT显示左下肺可见斑片状及条索状高密度影，血液分析显示白细胞升高，中性粒细胞比例升高，CRP升高等指标都支持这一诊断。肺部感染可能导致呼吸困难、氧合不足等问题，需要及时治疗以避免进一步并发症的发生。
