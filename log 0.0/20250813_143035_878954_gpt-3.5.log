You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS)', 'PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)', 'NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS)', 'CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity', 'HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk', 'Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score: "Calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score which is used to assess the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.
The score is used to track a patient's status during their stay in an intensive care unit to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.

- bilirubin (float): Serum bilirubin in mg/dL.
- map_pressure (float): Mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
- vasoactive_agents (int): Index indicating the vasoactive agents being used. Corresponds to 0 for no agents, 1 for low dose dopamine or any dose dobutamine, 2 for higher dose dopamine or low dose epinephrine/norepinephrine, 3 for very high dose of these agents.
- creatinine (float): Serum creatinine in mg/dL.

Returns:
int: Total SOFA score which is the sum of individual scores across the specified parameters."

Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS): Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.

PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9): Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.

Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP): Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表被用于评估该患者抑郁症的严重程度？}}
Task Scenario: {{Analysis:
The patient's case highlights severe depressive symptoms without psychotic features, including a persistent low mood, sleep disturbances, excessive worrying, feelings of guilt, suicidal ideation, and motor abnormalities like repetitive head movements and limb stiffness. The patient's refusal of treatment, lack of insight into her condition, and delusional beliefs suggest impaired judgment and insight. The MRI findings indicating slight degenerative changes in the bilateral frontal lobes and inflammation in the sinuses may contribute to cognitive and emotional disturbances. The patient's history of flood-related stressors and financial concerns also likely exacerbate her depressive symptoms. The treatment regimen with antidepressants and supportive therapies has led to improvement in the patient's condition.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. The user demand is to identify which assessment tool is used to evaluate the severity of depression in a patient.
2. Based on the user demand, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9).
3. The PHQ-9 is specifically designed to diagnose depression and quantify the severity of depressive symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder.
4. The PHQ-9 assesses various symptoms of depression such as interest/pleasure, feeling down, sleep issues, tiredness, appetite problems, self-esteem issues, concentration difficulties, activity levels, and suicidal thoughts.
5. Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3 based on the frequency and severity of the symptoms.
6. The total PHQ-9 score is the sum of individual scores for each symptom, providing an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.
7. Therefore, the PHQ-9 tool would be the most appropriate choice for evaluating the severity of depression in the described patient scenario.
