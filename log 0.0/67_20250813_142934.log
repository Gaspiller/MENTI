2025-08-13 14:29:56,372 - INFO - 1. interest_pleasure:
   - In the Reference Text, it mentions that the patient has been feeling down, depressed, and hopeless for 2 months. Given the severity of these symptoms, it is reasonable to infer that the patient is experiencing a lack of interest or pleasure in doing things.
   - Since the frequency is not explicitly stated but the severity is implied, we can assign a value of 2 to indicate 'More than half the days' from the Function Docstring for this parameter.
   
2. feeling_down:
   - It is explicitly mentioned in the Reference Text that the patient has been feeling down, depressed, and hopeless.
   - Given the severity of this symptom, we can assign a value of 3 to indicate 'Nearly every day' as per the Function Docstring.
   
3. sleep_issues:
   - The Reference Text indicates that the patient has been experiencing trouble falling or staying asleep for a month. This aligns with the sleep_issues parameter in the Function Docstring.
   - Since the frequency is not mentioned but the issue is there, we can assign a value of 2 to indicate 'More than half the days' from the Function Docstring.
   
4. tired_energy:
   - While the Reference Text does not explicitly state tiredness or lack of energy, based on the patient's depression symptoms, it is common for individuals to experience fatigue.
   - Considering this, we can assign a value of 2 to indicate 'More than half the days' as per the Function Docstring.
   
5. appetite_issues:
   - The Reference Text mentions appetite problems such as poor appetite.
   - Given this, we can assign a value of 2 to indicate 'More than half the days' for the appetite_issues parameter.
   
6. self_feeling:
   - The patient expresses feelings of being bad about oneself in the Reference Text.
   - We can assign a value of 2 to indicate 'More than half the days' for the self_feeling parameter.
   
7. concentration:
   - Although not directly mentioned in the Reference Text, the patient's difficulty in focusing and memory issues can be inferred from the depressive symptoms described.
   - Considering this, we can assign a value of 2 to indicate 'More than half the days' for the concentration parameter.
   
8. activity_level:
   - The Reference Text describes the patient's altered activity levels, where the patient stays at home all day and plays on the phone. This could indicate a change in activity level.
   - We can assign a value of 2 to indicate 'More than half the days' for the activity_level parameter.
   
9. suicidal_thoughts:
   - The patient denies having suicidal thoughts or wanting to die in the Reference Text.
   - Therefore, we can assign a value of 0 to indicate 'Not at all' for the suicidal_thoughts parameter.

{{Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.
