You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance)', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk', 'CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity', 'Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)', 'Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)', 'Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis', 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score: "Calculate the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score which is used to assess the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.
The score is used to track a patient's status during their stay in an intensive care unit to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.

Parameters:
- pao2_fio2_ratio (float): The ratio of arterial oxygen partial pressure to fractional inspired oxygen (mmHg).
- platelets (float): Platelet count in ×103/µL.

- bilirubin (float): Serum bilirubin in mg/dL.
- map_pressure (float): Mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
- vasoactive_agents (int): Index indicating the vasoactive agents being used. Corresponds to 0 for no agents, 1 for low dose dopamine or any dose dobutamine, 2 for higher dose dopamine or low dose epinephrine/norepinephrine, 3 for very high dose of these agents.

HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance): Calculate the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).

    The HOMA-IR is a clinical tool used to estimate insulin resistance (IR), which can be
    indicative of potential glucose intolerance and diabetes. It is particularly useful
    in scenarios where more invasive and time-consuming methods like the clamp measurement
    (considered the gold standard for measuring IR) are not feasible. Although the HOMA-IR
    provides a reasonable correlation with clamp measurements, it is less accurate on an
    individual basis, which suggests a need for caution in its clinical application and
    interpretation.

    Parameters:
    - fasting_insulin (float): The fasting insulin level in uIU/mL.
    - fasting_glucose (float): The fasting glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR score).

    Formula:
    HOMA-IR score = (fasting insulin * fasting glucose) / 405
