Detailed information of each tool: {{CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk: Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
    - history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(75, 'female', True, True, True, True, True)
