[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的肺炎严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病史和体格检查结果，患者主要表现为咳嗽、咳痰、气短半年余，胸部听诊可闻及散在哮鸣音，左下肺呼吸音弱，胸片显示左侧肺门处肿块。这些症状和表现可能提示患者患有支气管炎并可能伴有肺部肿块，需要进一步的检查和治疗以确定诊断和处理相应病变。可疑的诊断包括支气管炎并发肺部病变，但需要进一步检查以确诊和确定具体的治疗方案。
