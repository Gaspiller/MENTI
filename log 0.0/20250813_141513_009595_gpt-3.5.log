[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估上消化道出血患者的出血风险和适合门诊治疗的可能性？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和临床表现，主要疑点在于急性上消化道出血和重度贫血。患者出现呕血、失血量大，血红蛋白水平显著下降，血气分析显示血红蛋白和血乳酸异常升高，这些都与急性上消化道出血和失血性休克相符。另外，患者存在贫血表现，如面色无华、贫血貌、营养较差，进一步支持了重度贫血的诊断。由于患者曾有肝癌和消化道出血史，并且未及明显肿大的肝脾，可能存在原发性肝癌导致的上消化道出血，进一步检查可能需要进一步明确。
