Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.
    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.

HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance): Calculate the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).

    The HOMA-IR is a clinical tool used to estimate insulin resistance (IR), which can be
    indicative of potential glucose intolerance and diabetes. It is particularly useful
    in scenarios where more invasive and time-consuming methods like the clamp measurement
    (considered the gold standard for measuring IR) are not feasible. Although the HOMA-IR
    provides a reasonable correlation with clamp measurements, it is less accurate on an
    individual basis, which suggests a need for caution in its clinical application and
    interpretation.

    Parameters:
    - fasting_insulin (float): The fasting insulin level in uIU/mL.
    - fasting_glucose (float): The fasting glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR score).

    Formula:
    HOMA-IR score = (fasting insulin * fasting glucose) / 405

Corrected QT Interval (QTc): Calculate the Corrected QT Interval (QTc) for a patient.

    The QTc is used primarily to assess the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, especially torsades de pointes, 
    in patients with syncope or those receiving multiple QT-prolonging medications. A prolonged QT interval 
    can indicate a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This function corrects the QT interval to a heart rate 
    of 60 beats per minute, accounting for variations due to different heart rates.

    Parameters:
        qt_interval (float): The measured QT interval in milliseconds.
        heart_rate (float): The patient's heart rate in beats per minute.
        formula (str): The formula to use for correction. Options are 'Bazett', 'Fridericia', 
                       'Framingham', 'Hodges', and 'Rautaharju'.

    Returns:
        float: The corrected QT interval (QTc) in milliseconds.

    Example:
        >>> calculate_qtc(300, 70, 'Bazett')
        357.0

Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA): Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA) using provided weight and height.

    BMI is a measure of body fat based on weight and height that applies to adult men and women.
    It can be misleading for very muscular individuals or in specific ethnic groups with different
    body compositions and statures.

    BSA is often used in medical settings to determine the dosages of medications that are more 
    accurately calculated using body surface area rather than weight.

    Parameters:
    - weight_kg (float): Weight of the individual in kilograms.
    - height_cm (float): Height of the individual in centimeters.

    Returns:
    - dict: Dictionary containing 'BMI' and 'BSA' with their respective values.

HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk: Calculate the HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.
    
    The HAS-BLED Score is used to estimate the 1-year risk for major bleeding and helps guide decisions regarding anticoagulation therapy.
    This scoring system can be considered alongside other bleeding risk scores or thromboembolic risk assessments to weigh the benefits and risks of anticoagulation.

    Parameters:
    hypertension (bool): True if the patient has hypertension, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has renal disease (dialysis, transplant, or Cr >2.26 mg/dL), False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has liver disease (cirrhosis or bilirubin >2x normal with AST/ALT/AP >3x normal), False otherwise.
    stroke_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, False otherwise.
    major_bleeding_history (bool): True if the patient has had prior major bleeding or predisposition to bleeding, False otherwise.
    labile_inr (bool): True if the patient has labile INR (unstable/high INRs, time in therapeutic range <60%), False otherwise.
    elderly (bool): True if the patient is elderly (age >65), False otherwise.
    medication_risk (bool): True if the patient uses medication that predisposes to bleeding (aspirin, clopidogrel, NSAIDs), False otherwise.
    alcohol_usage (bool): True if the patient consumes alcohol significantly (≥8 drinks/week), False otherwise.

    Returns:
    int: The total HAS-BLED score, which is a sum of all applicable risk factors.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_has_bled_score(True, False, False, True, False, True, True, False, True)
    5
