[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的广泛性焦虑症状严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

分析：
根据患者的病史和临床表现，可以推断患者主要患有心脏神经官能症。心慌、气短、头晕、恶心等症状提示心脏神经系统可能存在异常，导致心脏功能受损，进而出现心慌气短、头晕等症状。心电图显示T波异常进一步支持心脏神经官能症的诊断。

可能受损的功能：心脏自律神经系统，导致心脏功能异常，出现心慌气短、头晕等症状。
