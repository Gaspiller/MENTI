    This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.


Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA): Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA) using provided weight and height.

    BMI is a measure of body fat based on weight and height that applies to adult men and women.
    It can be misleading for very muscular individuals or in specific ethnic groups with different
    body compositions and statures.

    BSA is often used in medical settings to determine the dosages of medications that are more 
    accurately calculated using body surface area rather than weight.

    Parameters:
    - weight_kg (float): Weight of the individual in kilograms.
    - height_cm (float): Height of the individual in centimeters.

    Returns:
    - dict: Dictionary containing 'BMI' and 'BSA' with their respective values.

Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia: Calculate the corrected calcium level in patients with suspected hypocalcemia
    who have low albumin levels. Hypocalcemia might not be apparent if serum albumin is low,
    thus this formula adjusts the calcium level based on albumin discrepancy.

    Args:
    normal_albumin (float): The normal albumin level in g/dL assumed for the calculation.
    patient_albumin (float): The patient's measured albumin level in g/dL.
    serum_ca (float): The patient's measured serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: The corrected serum calcium level in mg/dL.

    Example:
    >>> corrected_calcium(4.0, 3.2, 8.5)
    8.84
 

CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk: Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
    - history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(75, 'female', True, True, True, True, True)
    9

    Note that newer scores like the MELD and MELD-Na are generally preferred for their
    increased accuracy in prognosis.

    Parameters:
    - bilirubin (float): Total bilirubin level in mg/dL.
    - albumin (float): Albumin level in g/dL.
    - inr (float): International Normalized Ratio.
    - ascites (str): Describes the presence of ascites ('Absent', 'Slight', 'Moderate').
    - encephalopathy (int): Grade of hepatic encephalopathy (0 for none, 1-2 for Grade 1-2, 3-4 for Grade 3-4).

    Returns:
    - int: The Child-Pugh Score, ranging from 5 (best) to 15 (worst).

Anion Gap: Calculate the Anion Gap using sodium, chloride, and bicarbonate levels.

    The Anion Gap is a measure used in medicine to help diagnose the presence of an acidosis and whether it has an elevated anion gap. This calculation is essential in identifying the type of acidosis a patient might have, differentiating between gap and non-gap acidoses. Elevated Anion Gap suggests the presence of additional unmeasured anions in the blood, which could indicate conditions like ketoacidosis, lactic acidosis, or poisoning by substances such as methanol.

    Parameters:
    sodium (float): Sodium level in mEq/L.
    chloride (float): Chloride level in mEq/L.
    bicarbonate (float): Bicarbonate level in mEq/L.

    Returns:
    float: The calculated Anion Gap in mEq/L.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_anion_gap(140, 104, 24)
    12.0
 

Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity: Calculate the Serum Osmolality/Osmolarity using the Smithline-Gardner Formula.

    This function calculates the serum osmolality/osmolarity based on the concentrations of sodium, glucose,
    and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) in the blood. Serum osmolality is a measure of the solute concentration in the blood,
    and it can be used to assess the body's fluid and electrolyte balance. An osmolar gap (difference between measured
    and expected osmolality) greater than 10 can indicate the presence of certain toxic alcohols, mannitol, or propylene glycol.

    Note: At extreme levels of serum glucose, such as in hyperosmolar hyperglycemic state (HHS), the osmolar gap may be skewed,
    and clinical judgment should be used.

    Parameters:
    serum_na (float): Serum sodium concentration in mmol/L. Typical reference range is 135-145 mmol/L.
    serum_glucose (float): Serum glucose concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 70-100 mg/dL.
    serum_bun (float): Blood urea nitrogen concentration in mg/dL. Typical reference range is 7-20 mg/dL.

    Returns:
    float: Calculated serum osmolality in mOsm/kg.

    Formula:
    Serum Osmolality (mOsm/kg) = 2 * (serum_na) + (serum_glucose / 18) + (serum_bun / 2.8)


Ideal Body Weight and Adjusted Body Weight: Calculate the Ideal Body Weight (IBW) and Adjusted Body Weight (ABW) based on height and gender.
    
    The IBW calculation uses the Devine formula, which is applicable for individuals who are at least 60 inches tall.
    For individuals shorter than 5 feet, the IBW is adjusted by subtracting 2-5 lbs for each inch below 60 inches.
    The ABW is used for obese patients where the actual body weight exceeds the IBW, calculated as:
    ABW = IBW + 0.4 * (actual body weight - IBW).
    
    Parameters:
        height_in_inches (int): The height of the individual in inches.
        actual_body_weight (float): The actual body weight of the individual in kilograms.
        gender (str): The gender of the individual ("male" or "female").

    Returns:
        list: A list containing the IBW and ABW in kilograms. If the individual is not obese, ABW is set equal to IBW.

CIWA-Ar for Alcohol Withdrawal: Calculate the CIWA-Ar scale score for assessing alcohol withdrawal severity.

    The CIWA-Ar scale is intended for use in various medical settings where alcohol withdrawal is suspected.
    This tool helps in quantifying the severity of alcohol withdrawal through several symptom dimensions,
    each scored independently. The cumulative score helps guide clinical decisions regarding the necessity
