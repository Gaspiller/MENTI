You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism', 'NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS)', 'STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA)', 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications', 'HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{PERC Rule for Pulmonary Embolism: Calculate the Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) to determine if further testing for Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
    is unnecessary in patients considered low-risk.

    The PERC rule helps avoid unnecessary PE testing in low-risk patients. It requires that all criteria must be negative
    (i.e., all parameters must receive a 'no' to rule out PE without further testing).

    Parameters:
    - age_over_50 (bool): Whether the patient is aged 50 or older. False for no, True for yes.
    - heart_rate_over_100 (bool): Whether the patient has a heart rate of 100 bpm or higher. False for no, True for yes.
    - oxygen_saturation_under_95 (bool): Whether the patient has an oxygen saturation less than 95%. False for no, True for yes.
    - unilateral_leg_swelling (bool): Whether the patient has unilateral leg swelling. False for no, True for yes.
    - hemoptysis (bool): Whether the patient has hemoptysis (coughing up blood). False for no, True for yes.
    - recent_surgery_or_trauma (bool): Whether the patient had surgery or trauma within the last 4 weeks requiring general anesthesia. False for no, True for yes.
    - prior_pe_or_dvt (bool): Whether the patient has a history of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) or Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT). False for no, True for yes.

    Returns:
    - result (bool): True if the patient can be ruled out for PE without further testing (all criteria negative), False otherwise.


NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS): 
    Calculate the NIH Stroke Scale/Score (NIHSS).

    The NIHSS helps physicians quantify the severity of a stroke in the acute setting. 
    Increasing scores indicate a more severe stroke and correlate with the size of the infarction on both CT and MRI evaluation.
    Scores assessed within the first 48 hours following a stroke have been shown to correlate with clinical outcomes at the 3-month and 1-year mark.

Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA): Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) and Body Surface Area (BSA) using provided weight and height.

    BMI is a measure of body fat based on weight and height that applies to adult men and women.
    It can be misleading for very muscular individuals or in specific ethnic groups with different
    body compositions and statures.

    BSA is often used in medical settings to determine the dosages of medications that are more 
    accurately calculated using body surface area rather than weight.

    Parameters:
    - weight_kg (float): Weight of the individual in kilograms.
    - height_cm (float): Height of the individual in centimeters.

    Returns:
    - dict: Dictionary containing 'BMI' and 'BSA' with their respective values.

    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.


ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications: Calculate the ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications.

HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events:  Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:

        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.

         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7


PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP: Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
    It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表被用于术前评估患者的心脏风险？}}
Task Scenario: {{根据患者的病史和检查结果显示，患者是一名怀孕39周的孕妇，主诉规则腹痛。经过检查发现胎儿大小为3400g，胎方位LOA，宫颈已经开始消退，但宫颈扩张仍为0cm，胎膜未破。二维彩超显示胎儿健康状况良好，胎盘位于前壁。

根据以上情况可以推断，患者可能有一种称为盆腔不全的病情，即宫颈没有开始扩张，可能会导致分娩的困难和并发症。需要密切监测患者的情况，必要时可能需要进行干预措施来促进宫颈扩张以顺利进行分娩。}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. 根据用户需求，用户想要了解术前评估患者的心脏风险，根据不同的量表进行评估。

2. 首先根据患者的病史和检查结果，患者是一名孕妇，怀孕39周，主诉规则腹痛。经过检查发现胎儿大小为3400g，胎方位LOA，宫颈已经开始消退，但宫颈扩张仍为0cm，胎膜未破。根据二维彩超显示胎儿健康状况良好，胎盘位于前壁的情况分析，患者可能有盆腔不全的病情，需要密切监测患者的情况。

3. 量表中用于术前评估患者的心脏风险的工具是Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease。这个工具可以根据患者的年龄、性别、吸烟状况、总胆固醇水平、HDL胆固醇水平、收缩压、是否使用血压药等因素来计算患者患严重冠心病的风险。

4. 根据患者的状况，Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease并非适用。因为该工具主要适用于年龄30-79岁之间，且没有冠心病史、糖尿病或间歇性跛行的患者。

5. 最适合选择的工具是Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)。这个工具可以帮助评估手术患者患静脉血栓栓塞症的风险，根据多种危险因素对患者进行分层和评估患者接受预防干预的可能性。
