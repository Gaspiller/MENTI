Tool List: {{['PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP', 'CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity', 'ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis', 'CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)', 'HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea', 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP: Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.

    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

    Returns:
    int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.
    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.
 

CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.

    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,

        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7


STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea: Calculate the STOP-BANG Score for screening Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

    This score is useful for patients undergoing preoperative evaluation but should not be used if a patient
    has already been diagnosed with OSA or uses CPAP at night. It helps in identifying patients who might have
    OSA and are at increased risk of perioperative cardiopulmonary complications, as well as other morbidity
    associated with OSA like daytime sleepiness and cardiopulmonary conditions.

    Parameters:
    - snore_loudly (bool): True if the patient snores loudly (louder than talking or loud enough to be heard through closed doors), False otherwise.
    - feel_tired_daytime (bool): True if the patient often feels tired, fatigued, or sleepy during the daytime, False otherwise.
    - observed_apnea (bool): True if anyone has observed the patient stop breathing during sleep, False otherwise.
    - high_blood_pressure (bool): True if the patient has or is being treated for high blood pressure, False otherwise.
    - bmi (float): Body Mass Index of the patient.
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.

    - gender (str): Gender of the patient. Expected values: 'Female' or 'Male'.

    Returns:
    int: The total STOP-BANG score, ranging from 0 to 8.

    Usage:
    >>> calculate_stop_bang_score(True, True, True, True, 36, 51, 41, 'Male')
    8

    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.


Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality: Calculate the Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality.

    The Child-Pugh Score helps estimate the prognosis for a patient with cirrhosis.
