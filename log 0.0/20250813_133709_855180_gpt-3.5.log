You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the APACHE II Score for a patient in the ICU, to assess severity and predict mortality.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - temperature (float): Rectal temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - mean_arterial_pressure (int): Mean arterial pressure in mm Hg.
    - heart_rate (int): Heart rate in beats per minute.
    - respiratory_rate (int): Respiratory rate in breaths per minute.

    - gcs (int): Glasgow Coma Scale score, ranging from 3 (most impaired) to 15 (fully awake).
    - ph (float): Arterial pH.
    - history_of_severe_organ_insufficiency (int): Indicates the patient's history status, with 0 for 'No', 1 for 'Yes, and elective postoperative patient', and 2 for 'Yes, and nonoperative or emergency postoperative patient'.
    - acute_renal_failure (int): Indicates if the patient has acute renal failure, with 0 for 'No' and 1 for 'Yes'.
    - fio2 (int): Fraction of inspired oxygen, 0 for '<50%' and 1 for '≥50%'.
    - pao2 (float, optional): Partial pressure of arterial oxygen, required if FiO2 < 50%.
    - a_a_gradient (float, optional): Alveolar-arterial gradient, required if FiO2 ≥ 50%.

Reference Text:
{{There are parameters that require value input. Please provide specific values for the parameters.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. The age of the patient is not mentioned in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the age parameter.

2. The rectal temperature of the patient is not provided in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the temperature parameter.

3. The mean arterial pressure of the patient is not mentioned in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the mean_arterial_pressure parameter.

4. The heart rate of the patient is not provided in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the heart_rate parameter.

5. The respiratory rate of the patient is not mentioned in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the respiratory_rate parameter.

6. The serum sodium level of the patient is not mentioned in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the sodium parameter.

7. The serum potassium level of the patient is not provided in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the potassium parameter.

8. The serum creatinine level of the patient is not mentioned in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the creatinine parameter.

9. The hematocrit percentage of the patient is not provided in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the hematocrit parameter.

10. The white blood cell count of the patient is not mentioned in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the white_blood_cell_count parameter.

11. The Glasgow Coma Scale score of the patient is not provided in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the gcs parameter.

12. The arterial pH of the patient is not mentioned in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the ph parameter.

13. The history of severe organ insufficiency status of the patient is not provided in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the history_of_severe_organ_insufficiency parameter.

14. The acute renal failure status of the patient is not mentioned in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the acute_renal_failure parameter.

15. The fraction of inspired oxygen of the patient is not mentioned in the Reference Text, so we need to assign a specific value for the fio2 parameter.

16. The partial pressure of arterial oxygen of the patient is optional and is required if the FiO2 is less than 50%, but this information is not provided in the Reference Text.

17. The alveolar-arterial gradient of the patient is optional and is required if the FiO2 is greater than or equal to 50%, but this information is not provided in the Reference Text.
