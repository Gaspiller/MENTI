[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的肾小球滤过率？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病例信息，患者出现了黄曲霉菌感染所致的泌尿系统感染和右肾结石。这导致了急性肾衰竭的发生，表现为尿量减少、血常规显示白细胞计数升高、肌酐升高等。此外，患者已被诊断为2型糖尿病，血糖检测显示血糖较高。重度贫血也被观察到，表现为血红蛋白水平低。治疗结果显示病情好转。

由于泌尿系统感染、肾结石以及急性肾衰竭的存在，可能会导致肾功能受损，从而造成尿量减少及肌酐升高。2型糖尿病和重度贫血也可能会进一步影响患者的代谢和血液系统功能。因此，这些因素可能会影响患者的泌尿系统、肾功能、代谢和贫血情况。
