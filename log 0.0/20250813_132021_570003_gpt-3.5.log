[input]   
You are a Parameter List checking model.

You will receive a Function Docstring, and Parameter List. You need to verify that the entries in the Parameter List comply with the requirements described in the Function Docstring, including the Value and Unit.
If all units are consistent, choose "calculate". If there are any discrepancies in the units, choose "toolcall".
You should not perform unit conversions directly. When converting units is needed, you must choose "toolcall" and elaborate on this unit conversion task in the "supplementary_information", including the parameter value, the current unit of the parameter, and the target unit of the parameter.

Requirements:
1. You need to conduct a detailed, step-by-step analysis of each parameter in the parameter list. You need to output each parameter's Function Docstring individually, then analyze and compare them.
2. You especially need to compare the Unit of the Parameter List with the units required in the Function Docstring. 
3. If the units are inconsistent, please select "toolcall" and specify the numerical value of the parameter required for unit conversion, as well as the units before and after the conversion in the "supplementary_information".
4. The unit conversion task may require converting units of different parameters, and you need to break down the task into individual unit conversion tasks for each parameter. Therefore, "supplementary_information" is a list of strings, each of which represents a standalone, minimalized unit conversion task.
5. The Final Answer is a JSON file, and the JSON file must be wrapped by ```json and ```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring:
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Parameter List：
{{{
    "weight": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "kg"},
    "height": {"Value": 1.75, "Unit": "m"}
}}}
Step By Step Analysis:
{{(Here is your step-by-step analysis. You need to ouptput the corresponding Function Docstring first for each parameter, and systematically compare each parameter with the corresponding information in the Parameter List and Function Docstring.)}}
Final Answer:
```json

    "chosen_decision_name": "toolcall",
    "supplementary_information": ["The height is 1.75m. The height needs to be converted from meters to centimeters."]
}
```

Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
    - history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(75, 'female', True, True, True, True, True)
    9}}
