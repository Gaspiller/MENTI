You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis', 'Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality', 'Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk', 'PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP', 'CIWA-Ar for Alcohol Withdrawal', 'Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

    Parameters:
        age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.
        ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.
        platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).
        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.


Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality: Calculate the Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality.

    increased accuracy in prognosis.

    Parameters:
    - bilirubin (float): Total bilirubin level in mg/dL.
    - albumin (float): Albumin level in g/dL.
    - inr (float): International Normalized Ratio.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表用于评估酒精性肝硬化患者的肝功能程度和预后风险？}}
Task Scenario: {{Analysis:
The patient presents with a history of alcoholic cirrhosis, portal vein biliary disease leading to subacute liver failure. The main abnormality observed is the significantly elevated levels of total bilirubin (536.0μmol/L) and direct bilirubin (293.0μmol/L), indicating impaired liver function and obstructive jaundice. The presence of ascites and splenomegaly suggests portal hypertension. Additionally, the presence of multiple liver cysts, dilated intrahepatic bile ducts, and gallbladder inflammation with multiple stones further confirms the pre-existing liver pathology.

Speculated Impairments:
1. Impaired bile excretion due to obstructive jaundice from portal vein biliary disease.
2. Impaired liver synthetic function due to significantly elevated bilirubin levels.
3. Portal hypertension leading to ascites and splenomegaly.
4. Possible cholestatic liver damage indicated by elevated liver enzymes AST and ALT.

Further investigations and treatment, such as liver transplantation, are necessary to address the underlying liver dysfunction and complications.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. The user is asking for a tool to assess liver function and prognosis risk in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Based on the request, we need to choose a tool related to liver function assessment and prognosis in cirrhotic patients.

2. Among the tools provided in the Tool List, the most suitable tool for assessing liver function and prognosis in cirrhotic patients is the "Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality."

3. The Child-Pugh Score is specifically designed to estimate the prognosis of patients with cirrhosis, including alcoholic cirrhosis, by assessing various parameters such as bilirubin levels, albumin levels, INR, ascites presence, and encephalopathy grade.

4. By calculating the Child-Pugh Score for the patient with the mentioned clinical presentation, we can evaluate the severity of liver disease, predict mortality risk, and guide further management decisions.
