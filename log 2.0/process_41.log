2025-08-17 12:56:38,227 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess a patient's level of consciousness and degree of coma, which aligns with the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) from the Tool List.
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with a history of taking sedatives resulting in altered consciousness and a comatose state. The scenario also mentions sluggish pupillary light reflex and possible neurological impairment, indicating a need to evaluate the patient's level of consciousness.
3. Given that the Glasgow Coma Scale is specifically designed to assess consciousness levels in patients, it directly correlates with the keywords in both the User Demand and the Task Scenario.
4. The Glasgow Coma Scale assesses factors such as eye response, verbal response, and motor response to determine the patient's overall GCS score, making it a suitable tool for evaluating the patient's current state.
5. Based on the alignment of the User Demand, Task Scenario, and the purpose of the Glasgow Coma Scale as a tool for assessing consciousness and comatose states, the most appropriate choice from the Tool List is the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS).

2025-08-17 12:56:42,956 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{"Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed."}}
