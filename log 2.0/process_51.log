2025-08-17 13:01:29,886 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to predict the risk of major cardiac adverse events within 6 weeks for patients. This indicates a need for a cardiac risk assessment tool that focuses on predicting adverse cardiac events within a specific timeframe.

2. Reviewing the Tool List, the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events" aligns perfectly with the User Demand. This tool calculates the HEART Score based on specific categories like history, EKG, age, risk factors, and troponin level to help risk-stratify patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

3. Given that the task scenario describes a patient with a history of chest discomfort, palpitations, shortness of breath, diagnosed with coronary artery disease, ischemic heart disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure, the focus is on assessing the risk of cardiac events, making the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events" the most suitable tool.
