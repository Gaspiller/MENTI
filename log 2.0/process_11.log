   - 慢性肾炎 (Chronic Nephritis)
   - 肾小球滤过率 (Glomerular Filtration Rate)

2. **Tool List Review:**
   - CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) seems to directly match the keywords in the User Demand. It is explicitly designed to estimate the Glomerular Filtration Rate in patients with chronic kidney disease.

3. **Matching the User Demand with the Tool:**
   - The User Demand specifically asks for a scale to estimate the Glomerular Filtration Rate in patients with chronic nephritis, which aligns perfectly with the purpose of the CKD-EPI Equations tool.

4. **Final Tool Selection:**
   - Based on the keyword analysis and alignment with the User Demand, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the **CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)**.

2025-08-17 12:41:18,679 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

Parameters:
- serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
- age (int): The age of the patient in years.
- gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

Returns:
- float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

Usage:
To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

Note:
- Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
- Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.

Parameter List:
{
    "serum_creatinine": {"Value": 1.095, "Unit": "mg/dL"},
    "age": {"Value": 74, "Unit": "years"},
    "gender": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}
}
Step By Step Analysis:
For parameter 'serum_creatinine':
- Function Docstring specifies: The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
- Parameter List has Value: 1.095, Unit: mg/dL.
- Both Function Docstring and Parameter List units match, no unit conversion needed.

For parameter 'age':
- Function Docstring specifies: The age of the patient in years.
- Parameter List has Value: 74, Unit: years.
- Both Function Docstring and Parameter List units match, no unit conversion needed.

For parameter 'gender':
- Function Docstring specifies: The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.
- Parameter List has Value: 1, Unit: null.
- Gender does not have a unit in the Function Docstring.
- Both Function Docstring and Parameter List units match, no unit conversion needed.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use indices to specify units."
}
