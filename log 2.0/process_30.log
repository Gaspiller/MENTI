2025-08-17 12:51:16,797 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool to assess liver fibrosis in HBV patients.
2. The Task Scenario mentions abnormal liver function test results, which align with the need to evaluate liver fibrosis.
3. Considering the focus on liver fibrosis in HBV patients, the most suitable tool from the provided list is the "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis."
4. The Fibrosis-4 Index is designed to estimate the level of liver fibrosis, making it directly relevant to the user's demand and the patient's condition.
5. By utilizing the parameters of age, AST, platelets, and ALT, the Fibrosis-4 Index can provide a score to categorize the severity of liver fibrosis.
6. Therefore, based on the alignment with the core keyword of "HBV patients' liver fibrosis assessment" and the specific focus on liver function in the scenario, the most appropriate choice is the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index tool.

2025-08-17 12:51:21,679 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

    Parameters:
        age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.
        ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.
        platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).
        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.

Parameter List：
{{{"age": {"Value": 56, "Unit": "years"}, "ast": {"Value": 16, "Unit": "U/L"}, "platelets": {"Value": 207, "Unit": "x10^9/L"}, "alt": {"Value": 4, "Unit": "U/L"}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:

1. For age:
    Function Docstring: "age (int or float): Age of the patient in years."
    Parameter List: {"Value": 56, "Unit": "years"}

2. For ast:
    Function Docstring: "ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L."
    Parameter List: {"Value": 16, "Unit": "U/L"}

3. For platelets:
    Function Docstring: "platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L)."
    Parameter List: {"Value": 207, "Unit": "x10^9/L"}

4. For alt:
    Function Docstring: "alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L."
    Parameter List: {"Value": 4, "Unit": "U/L"}
