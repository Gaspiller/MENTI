2025-08-17 12:57:25,639 - INFO - 1. The User Demand mentions evaluating upper gastrointestinal bleeding patients for outpatient treatment eligibility. This aligns closely with the "Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)" tool, which is used specifically to assess adult patients for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.
2. The Task Scenario confirms the presence of gastrointestinal bleeding in the patient, indicating a potential match with the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score tool, as it assesses the severity and need for intervention in such cases.
3. The Task Scenario also mentions findings related to anemia, renal function, arterial sclerosis, and lack of liver disease history, further reinforcing the focus on evaluating bleeding severity and potential risks, which the GBS tool is designed to address.
4. Considering the core keywords in both the User Demand and Task Scenario, the most suitable tool from the provided list is the "Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)."

    Parameters:
    - hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
    - bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
    - syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
    - cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

    Returns:
    - int: Glasgow-Blatchford Score, ranging from 0 to 23.

    This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
    Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.
