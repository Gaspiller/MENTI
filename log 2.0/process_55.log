2025-08-17 13:03:41,828 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool specifically used to predict the risk of major cardiac adverse events within 6 weeks. This aligns with the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events" tool from the Tool List.

2. The Task Scenario provides information about the patient's diagnosis of coronary heart disease, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and narrowing of the cerebral arteries. The main symptom is episodic chest pain with back and upper arm discomfort, along with coughing and sputum production. The patient is also diagnosed with a segmental narrowing of the left posterior cerebral artery. Given the cardiovascular conditions and symptoms mentioned, the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events would be appropriate to assess the risk of major cardiac events for this patient.

Final Answer:
```json

    "chosen_tool_name": "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"
}

2025-08-17 13:03:49,252 - INFO - {{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

Parameter List：
{{{
    "history_score": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null},
    "ekg_score": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null},
    "age_score": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null},
    "risk_factors_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null},
    "troponin_score": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}
}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
For history_score:
Function Docstring specifies the parameter as an integer without any specific unit requirement. The given Value in the Parameter List is 1, which is an integer and meets the requirement. Therefore, the unit is consistent.

For ekg_score:
Function Docstring specifies the parameter as an integer without any specific unit requirement. The given Value in the Parameter List is 0, which is an integer and meets the requirement. Therefore, the unit is consistent.

For age_score:
Function Docstring specifies the parameter as an integer without any specific unit requirement. The given Value in the Parameter List is 1, which is an integer and meets the requirement. Therefore, the unit is consistent.

For risk_factors_score:
Function Docstring specifies the parameter as an integer without any specific unit requirement. The given Value in the Parameter List is 2, which is an integer and meets the requirement. Therefore, the unit is consistent.

For troponin_score:
Function Docstring specifies the parameter as an integer without any specific unit requirement. The given Value in the Parameter List is 0, which is an integer and meets the requirement. Therefore, the unit is consistent.
