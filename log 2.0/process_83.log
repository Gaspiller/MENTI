2025-08-17 13:16:35,219 - INFO - Based on the User Demand, which asks for a tool used to assess a patient's cardiac risk before high-risk surgery, the most suitable tool from the given list is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

1. The tool specifically mentions that it is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery.
2. The Task Scenario, although focusing on placenta previa and bleeding during pregnancy, highlights the need to monitor the patient for signs of worsening bleeding and to ensure optimal management to prevent complications. In this context, the focus on monitoring and preventing complications aligns with the need to assess the patient's cardiac risk before a high-risk surgical procedure.
3. While other tools in the list address topics like bleeding risk, pulmonary complications, venous thromboembolism, stroke risk, and major cardiac events, the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" directly relates to assessing cardiac risk before surgery, making it the most appropriate choice given the User Demand and Task Scenario.

Therefore, the chosen tool is:
```json
{
    "chosen_tool_name": "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk"
}
```

2025-08-17 13:16:41,264 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
