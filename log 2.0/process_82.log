2025-08-17 13:16:07,428 - INFO - Based on the User Demand and the Task Scenario, we are looking for a tool that can assess the patient's cardiac risk pre-operatively, particularly in the context of uterine fibroid (子宫肌瘤) resection surgery. The scenario mentions irregular endometrial hyperplasia and the placement of a cardiac pacemaker as well, indicating a need for comprehensive cardiac risk evaluation.

Among the tools provided in the Tool List, the most suitable tool for assessing the patient's cardiac risk pre-operatively in the context of uterine fibroid resection surgery is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk." This tool is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, making it highly relevant for the scenario described.

The Revised Cardiac Risk Index takes into account factors such as elevated risk surgery, history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, preoperative insulin treatment, and preoperative creatinine levels. These factors align well with the complexity of the patient's condition as described in the scenario, including the need to monitor cardiac function post-cardiac pacemaker placement.

Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List for assessing the patient's cardiac risk pre-operatively in the context of uterine fibroid resection surgery is:
"Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-17 13:16:16,868 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
