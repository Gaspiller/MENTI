2025-08-17 13:18:50,658 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in a patient undergoing non-cardiac surgery. The core keyword here is "non-cardiac surgery" indicating a patient undergoing surgery that is not directly related to the heart.

2. Looking at the Tool List, the tool that aligns most closely with the User Demand is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk." This tool specifically calculates the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

3. The tool analyzes risk factors such as elevated risk surgery, history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, treatment with insulin, and preoperative creatinine levels to generate a total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score.

4. Given the patient's case scenario with gestational diabetes, uterine scarring, congenital heart disease, IVF-ET procedure, and pelvic adhesions, the tool "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" is the most suitable choice to assess the patient's risk of major cardiac complications during non-cardiac surgery.

2025-08-17 13:18:57,477 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
