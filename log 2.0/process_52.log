2025-08-17 13:02:15,182 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to predict the risk of cardiac events, especially for patients with congenital heart disease. This indicates a need for a risk assessment tool tailored to cardiac events in patients with congenital heart conditions.

2. Looking at the provided Task Scenario, it describes a patient with congenital heart disease, including details about atrial septal defect, mild tricuspid regurgitation, right heart enlargement, pericardial effusion, anemia, and splenomegaly. The scenario highlights the compromised cardiac function of the patient, which could lead to issues like decreased cardiac function and impaired blood circulation.

3. Considering the keywords in both the User Demand and Task Scenario, the tool that aligns most closely with the need to predict cardiac event risk in patients with congenital heart disease is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events." This tool assesses chest pain patients' risk in the emergency setting, which includes evaluating factors like history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels to categorize patients into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome.

2025-08-17 13:02:25,751 - INFO - {{Calculate the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
