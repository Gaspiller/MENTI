2025-08-17 12:56:10,662 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess the level of consciousness and neurological function in a patient, indicated by the term "昏迷程度和神经系统功能" (level of coma and neurological function).
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with sudden consciousness disturbance, hypertension, diabetes, a history of heart disease, and a CT scan showing cerebral hemorrhage with hematoma formation. The patient is comatose with a GCS score of 4 (E1V1M2) and dilated non-reactive pupils, indicating a severe neurological condition due to cerebral hemorrhage.
3. Considering the keywords "level of coma," "neurological function," "consciousness disturbance," and the patient's condition of cerebral hemorrhage leading to a coma, the most suitable tool would be the "Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS)" from the Tool List.
4. The GCS is specifically designed to assess the level of consciousness, neurological function, and coma severity in patients, making it an ideal choice for evaluating the patient's condition.
5. The GCS provides a comprehensive evaluation based on eye, verbal, and motor responses, which is crucial in determining the neurological status and assisting in patient management decisions.
6. Therefore, the chosen tool to assess the patient's condition in this scenario is the "Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS)."

2025-08-17 12:56:19,923 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.}}
Parameter List：{{{"eye_response": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, "verbal_response": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, "motor_response": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
Parameter: eye_response
Function Docstring:
eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response

Parameter List:
Value: 1, Unit: null

Comparison:
The function docstring requires eye_response as an integer or string representing the score or 'NT' (not testable). No specific unit is mentioned. The parameter list entry for eye_response has a value of 1, but the correct unit is indicated as null (no unit specified). Since eye_response is not a quantity requiring units, the unit check is not applicable.

Parameter: verbal_response
Function Docstring:
verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response

Parameter List:
Value: 1, Unit: null

Comparison:
The function docstring requires verbal_response as an integer or string representing the score or 'NT' (not testable). No specific unit is mentioned. The parameter list entry for verbal_response has a value of 1, but the correct unit is indicated as null (no unit specified). Since verbal_response is not a quantity requiring units, the unit check is not applicable.

Parameter: motor_response
Function Docstring:
motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

Parameter List:
Value: 2, Unit: null

Comparison:
The function docstring requires motor_response as an integer or string representing the score or 'NT' (not testable). No specific unit is mentioned. The parameter list entry for motor_response has a value of 2, but the correct unit is indicated as null (no unit specified). Since motor_response is not a quantity requiring units, the unit check is not applicable.

Final Answer:

{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters do not require units."
