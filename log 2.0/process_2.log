2025-08-17 12:37:11,944 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks which tool is used to assess the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in surgical patients.
2. Reviewing the Tool List, the tool that directly addresses assessing the risk of VTE in surgical patients is the "Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)".
3. The Caprini Score for VTE in surgical patients takes into account various risk factors related to surgery, patient history, and other conditions to determine the risk of VTE.
4. Considering the given scenario of a patient with non-septic cavernous sinus thrombophlebitis, the risk of VTE could be pertinent in this case due to the potential for surgical intervention or treatment modalities that may increase the risk of VTE.
5. Therefore, the most suitable tool based on the User Demand and Task Scenario is the "Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)".
