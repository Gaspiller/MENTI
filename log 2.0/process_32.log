2025-08-17 12:52:09,593 - INFO - 1. The core keyword in the User Demand is "coronary artery atherosclerosis," which refers to the development of atherosclerotic plaques in the coronary arteries, leading to heart disease and potential cardiac events.
2. The Task Scenario highlights the patient's risk factors for cardiovascular events, including high blood pressure, reduced ejection fraction, diabetes, and elevated cholesterol levels. These factors contribute to the risk of coronary artery atherosclerosis and subsequent cardiac events.
3. Considering the patient's case and the focus on evaluating the risk of a coronary heart disease event within the next 10 years, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease."
4. The Framingham Risk Score specifically assesses the risk of developing hard coronary heart disease in patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease but with risk factors such as age, sex, smoking status, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure.
5. By inputting the patient's relevant data such as age, sex, smoking status, cholesterol levels, and blood pressure into the Framingham Risk Score calculator, we can estimate the 10-year risk of a coronary heart disease event accurately.

{{Calculate the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease in patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease history, diabetes, or intermittent claudication.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
    - sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
    - total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    Returns:
    float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.
