2025-08-17 13:03:17,822 - INFO - 1. The core keyword in the User Demand is "未来6周发生重大心脏不良事件的风险" which translates to the risk of major cardiac events in the next 6 weeks.
2. The Task Scenario mentions specific conditions such as acute non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and a history of type 2 diabetes for 15 years, indicating a focus on cardiac risk assessment and potential complications related to heart health.
3. Given the emphasis on assessing the risk of major cardiac events in a patient with both acute myocardial infarction and long-standing diabetes, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."
4. The HEART Score is specifically designed to risk-stratify patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome, making it directly relevant to the User Demand and Task Scenario.
5. By using the HEART Score in this context, healthcare providers can better assess the patient's cardiac risk profile and make informed decisions regarding further monitoring and management strategies.
6. Therefore, the most appropriate tool to choose from the Tool List is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-17 13:03:22,667 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{"
Args:
history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
    0 = Slightly suspicious,
    1 = Moderately suspicious,
    2 = Highly suspicious.
ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
    0 = Normal,
    1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
    2 = Significant ST deviation.
age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
    0 = less than 45,
    1 = between 45 and 64,
    2 = 65 or older.
risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
    0 = No known risk factors,
    1 = 1–2 risk factors,
    2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
    0 = ≤ normal limit,
    1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
    2 = >3 times normal limit.

Returns:
int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
     in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
     0-3 points indicate low risk,
     4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
     7-10 points indicate high risk.

    "troponin_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null}
}}}
Step By Step Analysis:
The history_score, ekg_score, age_score, risk_factors_score, and troponin_score are all integer values and do not have associated units. 
All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. 
No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use indices to specify scores.
