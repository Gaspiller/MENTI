2025-08-17 13:16:59,578 - INFO - 1. The User Demand mentions evaluating the patient's postoperative risk, indicating a need for a tool that assesses risk in a surgical or postoperative setting.
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with lung cancer and metastasis to the thoracic vertebra, highlighting respiratory compromise and potential musculoskeletal issues like spinal cord compression leading to back pain.
3. Given the focus on postoperative risk assessment in a patient with lung cancer and thoracic vertebra involvement, the tool most aligned with this scenario would be the "CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity" from the Tool List.
4. The CURB-65 Score is specifically designed to assess the severity of pneumonia in patients, which is relevant in the context of lung cancer with respiratory involvement.
5. The parameters of the CURB-65 Score, such as confusion, respiratory rate, and age, can provide insight into the severity of pneumonia and potential postoperative risks in this patient.
6. Therefore, based on the alignment with assessing postoperative risk in a patient with lung cancer and thoracic vertebra metastasis, the most suitable tool from the list is the "CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity."

    Calculate the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.

    The CURB-65 calculator can be used in the emergency department setting to risk stratify a patient’s community acquired pneumonia.
    It includes points for confusion, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age.
    
    Parameters:
    confusion (int): Confusion status, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes.
    bun (int): Blood urea nitrogen status, where 0 = BUN ≤ 19 mg/dL (≤ 7 mmol/L urea) and 1 = BUN > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L urea).
    respiratory_rate (int): Respiratory rate status, where 0 = < 30 breaths/min and 1 = ≥ 30 breaths/min.
    blood_pressure (int): Blood pressure status, where 0 = Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg, and 1 = Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg.
    age (int): Age status, where 0 = < 65 years and 1 = ≥ 65 years.

    Returns:
    int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

    Usage:
    This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.
    
    Example:
    >>> curb_65_score(1, 1, 1, 0, 1)
    4
