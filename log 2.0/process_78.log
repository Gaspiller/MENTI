2025-08-17 13:14:25,278 - INFO - In the Task Scenario provided, the focus is on assessing the cardiac risk of a patient in the context of an obstetric case involving a pregnant woman at 39+ weeks of gestation presenting with regular abdominal pain and certain risk factors. The scenario does not directly align with tools like CURB-65 for pneumonia severity, SOFA score for ICU assessment, or STOP-BANG for obstructive sleep apnea screening.

Given the specific emphasis on preoperative cardiac risk assessment in the Task Scenario, the most relevant tool from the Tool List is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk." This tool is explicitly designed for calculating the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing surgery, making it the ideal choice for the present scenario.

Therefore, based on a comprehensive analysis of the keywords in the User Demand and the clinical details provided in the Task Scenario, the most suitable tool to choose is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-17 13:14:34,914 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
