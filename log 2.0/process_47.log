2025-08-17 12:59:38,110 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool that predicts the risk of major cardiac events within 6 weeks for a patient. This aligns with the tool "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events" from the Tool List, which specifically calculates the risk of acute coronary syndrome (ACS) based on various parameters.

2. The Task Scenario mentions abnormalities related to the patient's heart function, such as left ventricular enlargement, decreased systolic and diastolic function, and other cardiac abnormalities. These abnormalities are indicative of potential cardiac issues and align well with the purpose of the HEART Score tool.

3. The HEART Score tool is designed to assess patients presenting with chest pain and to risk-stratify them into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome. Given the focus on predicting major cardiac events in the User Demand, the HEART Score tool is the most suitable choice based on the provided information.

Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List is "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events".

2025-08-17 12:59:44,875 - INFO - {{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)

Step By Step Analysis:
{{"history_score":
According to the Function Docstring, the history_score is an integer representing different levels of suspicion based on patient history assessment. The Parameter List provides the correct format of an integer. The units are not applicable here as it is a discrete score. Thus, all requirements are met.

"ekg_score":
In the Function Docstring, ekg_score is an integer representing different EKG findings. The Parameter List also provides the correct format of an integer. The units are not applicable here as it is a discrete score. Thus, all requirements are met.

"age_score":
The age_score in the Function Docstring is an integer representing different age groups. The Parameter List correctly provides an integer format. The units are not applicable here as it is a discrete score. Thus, all requirements are met.

"risk_factors_score":
As per the Function Docstring, risk_factors_score is an integer representing different cardiovascular risk factors. The Parameter List provides an integer format. The units are not applicable here as it is a discrete score. Thus, all requirements are met.

"troponin_score":
The troponin_score is an integer representing different troponin level categories in the Function Docstring. The Parameter List provides the correct integer format. The units are not applicable here as it is a discrete score. Thus, all requirements are met.
