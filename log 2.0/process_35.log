2025-08-17 12:53:29,131 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms in adults.
2. Among the tools listed, the most suitable tool for assessing the severity of anxiety symptoms in adults is the "GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7)" tool.
3. The GAD-7 tool is explicitly designed to calculate the severity of various signs of anxiety based on a seven-item assessment over the past two weeks.
4. It is a quick screening tool for detecting clinically significant anxiety disorders, including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
5. The GAD-7 tool aligns perfectly with the core medical intent of assessing anxiety symptoms' severity, making it the most appropriate choice for the User Demand in this scenario.

2025-08-17 12:53:36,786 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
to assess and monitor treatment responses.

Parameters:
- nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
- control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
- worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
- trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
- restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
- irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
- fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

Returns:
int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

Usage Example:
gad_7_score = calculate_gad_7(3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score

Parameter List：
{
    "nervous": {"Value": 3, "Unit": null},
    "control_worrying": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null},
    "worry_too_much": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null},
    "trouble_relaxing": {"Value": 3, "Unit": null},

    "irritability": {"Value": 3, "Unit": null},
    "fear_of_awful_events": {"Value": 3, "Unit": null}
}

Step By Step Analysis:
1. Parameter - nervous:
    Function Docstring: nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
    Parameter List: Value: 3
    Analysis: The parameters are consistent with the Function Docstring requirements.

2. Parameter - control_worrying:
    Function Docstring: control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
    Parameter List: Value: 2
    Analysis: The parameters are consistent with the Function Docstring requirements.

3. Parameter - worry_too_much:
    Function Docstring: worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
    Parameter List: Value: 2
    Analysis: The parameters are consistent with the Function Docstring requirements.

4. Parameter - trouble_relaxing:
    Function Docstring: trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
    Parameter List: Value: 3
    Analysis: The parameters are consistent with the Function Docstring requirements.

5. Parameter - restlessness:
    Function Docstring: restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
    Parameter List: Value: 3
    Analysis: The parameters are consistent with the Function Docstring requirements.

6. Parameter - irritability:
    Function Docstring: irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
    Parameter List: Value: 3
    Analysis: The parameters are consistent with the Function Docstring requirements.

7. Parameter - fear_of_awful_events:
    Function Docstring: fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.
    Parameter List: Value: 3
    Analysis: The parameters are consistent with the Function Docstring requirements.
