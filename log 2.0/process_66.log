2. The Task Scenario provides detailed information about a patient being diagnosed with moderate to severe depression, describing key symptoms and features relevant to assessing depression severity.
3. Given the focus on assessing the severity of depression in the patient, the most suitable tool from the provided list would be the "PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)".
4. The PHQ-9 is specifically designed to diagnose depression and quantify the severity of depressive symptoms based on the DSM criteria.
5. The tool involves scoring nine criteria related to depression symptoms to determine the overall severity of depression in a patient.

2025-08-17 13:08:06,819 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.

Parameter List:
{{{"interest_pleasure": {"Value": 3, "Unit": null}, 
"feeling_down": {"Value": 3, "Unit": null}, 
"sleep_issues": {"Value": 3, "Unit": null}, 
"tired_energy": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null},
