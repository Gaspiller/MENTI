2025-08-17 13:15:43,691 - INFO - 1. The User Demand mentions "评估患者在进行利凡诺穿刺引产术前的心脏风险," which translates to "assessing the patient's cardiac risk before undergoing amniocentesis termination of pregnancy." This indicates a need for evaluating the patient's cardiac risk specifically in the context of the procedure they are about to undergo.

2. Reviewing the Tool List, the tool that directly aligns with assessing cardiac risk in a preoperative setting is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk." This tool is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery and can aid in decision-making regarding preoperative risk assessments.

3. The Task Scenario provides additional details about the patient's case, highlighting the genetic disorder trisomy 18 and the decision for termination of pregnancy. Given the focus on the patient's cardiac risk assessment before the amniocentesis procedure, it reaffirms the relevance of the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" in this scenario.
