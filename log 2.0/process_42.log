2025-08-17 12:57:00,669 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifies the need for a tool used for risk assessment and stratification of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. This aligns with the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) from the provided tool list.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with a history of duodenal bulb ulcer bleeding resulting in anemia and presenting symptoms such as melena, decreased hemoglobin levels, decreased red blood cell count, and decreased hematocrit. The treatment involved endoscopic hemostasis for the duodenal bulb ulcer, indicating a focus on upper gastrointestinal bleeding, which further supports the relevance of the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS).

3. Given that the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) is specifically designed to assess the severity of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and aid in determining the need for hospital admission based on the patient's condition, it is the most suitable tool for this scenario.

2025-08-17 12:57:05,807 - INFO - {{Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.

Parameters:
- hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
- bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
- systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
- sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
- heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
- melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
- syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
- hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
- cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

Returns:
- int: Glasgow-Blatchford Score, ranging from 0 to 23.

This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.

Parameter List：
{{{"hemoglobin": {"Value": 9.5, "Unit": "g/dL"}, "bun": {"Value": 9.8, "Unit": "mg/dL"}, "systolic_bp": {"Value": 116, "Unit": "mmHg"}, "sex": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, "heart_rate": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}, "melena": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, "syncope": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}, "hepatic_disease": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}, "cardiac_failure": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
- For parameter "hemoglobin":
    - Function Docstring requires the parameter to be in "g/dL" unit.
    - The given value is already in "g/dL".
- For parameter "bun":
    - Function Docstring requires the parameter to be in "mg/dL" unit.
    - The given value is already in "mg/dL".
- For parameter "systolic_bp":
    - Function Docstring requires the parameter to be in "mm Hg" unit.
    - The given value is already in "mm Hg".
- For parameter "sex":
    - The unit is not applicable for this parameter as it is categorical (0 for female, 1 for male).
- For parameter "heart_rate":
    - The unit is not applicable for this parameter as it is categorical.
- For parameter "melena":
    - The unit is not applicable for this parameter as it is categorical.
- For parameter "syncope":
    - The unit is not applicable for this parameter as it is categorical.
- For parameter "hepatic_disease":
    - The unit is not applicable for this parameter as it is categorical.
- For parameter "cardiac_failure":
    - The unit is not applicable for this parameter as it is categorical.

Final Answer:

{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use categorical values."
