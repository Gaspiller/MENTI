2025-08-17 12:54:25,979 - INFO - Based on the User Demand asking for a tool used to evaluate a patient's level of consciousness and coma status, and the Task Scenario describing a patient who is unconscious and potentially affected by central nervous system damage, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS). The GCS is specifically designed to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are in a coma due to various medical reasons, including central nervous system damage, which aligns perfectly with the presented scenario.

The Glasgow Coma Scale considers the patient's eye, verbal, and motor responses to determine a total score that reflects the severity of the coma or altered mental state. This tool is crucial in monitoring trends in a patient's mental status, facilitating communication among healthcare providers, and aiding in decision-making regarding patient management, all of which are essential in the described case of a potentially unconscious patient with likely central nervous system involvement due to a gas leak incident.

Therefore, the most appropriate tool to choose based on the User Demand and Task Scenario is the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS).

2025-08-17 12:54:31,151 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.}}
