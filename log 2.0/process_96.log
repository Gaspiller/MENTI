2025-08-17 13:22:14,887 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool to assess the cardiac risk of patients preoperatively.
2. The Task Scenario provides information about a patient with acute drug poisoning, stab wound in the right anterior chest and abdomen, and hemorrhagic anemia. The treatment involves supportive care and surgery for the hemorrhagic anemia. The scenario suggests a need to closely monitor bleeding and hemoglobin levels, indicating a focus on cardiac risk assessment.
3. Given the focus on cardiac risk assessment in the scenario and the specific mention of the need to monitor the patient's hemoglobin levels and bleeding status post acute poisoning and surgical intervention, the most appropriate tool from the Tool List is "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
4. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing surgery, aligning well with the preoperative evaluation needed in the scenario.

2025-08-17 13:22:23,101 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
