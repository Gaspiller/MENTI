2025-08-17 13:02:49,067 - INFO - 1. User Demand Analysis:
   - The user demand is asking for a tool that can predict the risk of major cardiac events in heart patients in the next 6 weeks.
   - The scenario provided describes a patient with acute myocardial infarction, presenting with symptoms such as chest pain, palpitations, pulsatile headaches, and dizziness. The patient has a history of significant hypertension, diabetes, multiple cardiovascular diseases, and stroke, indicating a high cardiovascular disease risk. Additional tests show abnormal ECG findings, elevated troponin I levels, and coronary CTA findings supporting the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.
   - The patient may have impaired cardiovascular function affecting myocardial blood supply and myocardial contractile function, suggesting potential issues such as inadequate myocardial blood supply and myocardial infarction.
   
2. Tool Analysis:
   - The tool that best fits the user demand and scenario is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."
   - The HEART Score is specifically designed to risk-stratify emergency department patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) based on parameters such as history, EKG findings, age, cardiovascular risk factors, and troponin levels.
   - Given the patient's presentation with acute myocardial infarction, a history of cardiovascular diseases, and abnormal test results indicating possible cardiovascular dysfunction, the HEART Score would be highly relevant in predicting the risk of major cardiac events in the next 6 weeks.

3. Final Answer:

    "chosen_tool_name": "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"

2025-08-17 13:02:54,476 - INFO - {{"Calculate the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
