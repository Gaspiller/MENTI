2025-08-17 13:21:35,229 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Corrected Sodium for Hyperglycemia using Hillier's method from 1999.

    This function computes the corrected sodium level in patients with hyperglycemia,
    accounting for osmotic shifts of water from the intracellular to the extracellular space,
    which can lead to dilutional hyponatremia. The formula uses a correction factor of 2.4 mEq/L
    for every 100 mg/dL increase in serum glucose above the normal threshold of 100 mg/dL.

    Parameters:
        measured_sodium (float): The measured sodium level in mEq/L.
        serum_glucose (float): The serum glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
        float: The corrected sodium level in mEq/L.

    Example:
        >>> sodium_correction_hyperglycemia(140, 200)
        142.4}}

{{{
    "measured_sodium": {"Value": 145.0, "Unit": "mEq/L"},
    "serum_glucose": {"Value": 228.8, "Unit": "mg/dL"}
}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
1. Parameter: measured_sodium
   Function Docstring: The measured sodium level should be in mEq/L.
   Parameter List: The measured sodium level value is 145.0 mEq/L.
   Analysis: The unit in the Parameter List matches the requirement in the Function Docstring.

2. Parameter: serum_glucose
   Function Docstring: The serum glucose level should be in mg/dL.
   Parameter List: The serum glucose level value is 228.8 mg/dL.
   Analysis: The unit in the Parameter List matches the requirement in the Function Docstring.

Final Answer:

{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use consistent units."
