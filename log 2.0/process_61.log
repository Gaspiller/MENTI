2025-08-17 13:06:09,301 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333}}
Parameter Listï¼š
{{{"systolic_bp": {"Value": 240, "Unit": "mmHg"}, "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 140, "Unit": "mmHg"}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
"I will start by analyzing the 'systolic_bp' parameter based on the provided information."

Function Docstring for 'systolic_bp':
systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.

Parameter List for 'systolic_bp':
Value: 240
Unit: mmHg

Comparison:
The value and unit for 'systolic_bp' match the requirements in the Function Docstring. No unit conversion needed.

"I will now move on to analyze the 'diastolic_bp' parameter."

Function Docstring for 'diastolic_bp':
diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.

Parameter List for 'diastolic_bp':
Value: 140
Unit: mmHg

Comparison:
The value and unit for 'diastolic_bp' also match the requirements in the Function Docstring. No unit conversion needed.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use indices to specify units."
