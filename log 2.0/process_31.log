2025-08-17 12:51:44,173 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool that assesses the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease (冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病) in patients. This specifically relates to predicting the likelihood of a cardiac event related to atherosclerosis within a 10-year timeframe.

2. Among the tools provided in the list, the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease" is the most suitable choice for evaluating the risk of coronary heart disease over a 10-year period. This tool calculates the risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease based on factors such as age, sex, smoking status, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and medication.

3. Considering the patient's medical history and symptoms provided in the Task Scenario, the presence of coronary heart disease and ischemic heart muscle disease align with the need to assess the risk of a cardiac event over a prolonged timeframe.

4. The symptoms indicating heart failure and myocardial ischemia further emphasize the importance of accurately predicting the long-term risk of coronary heart disease in this patient.

{{Calculate the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease in patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease history, diabetes, or intermittent claudication.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
    - sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
    - total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    Returns:
    float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.
