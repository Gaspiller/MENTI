2025-08-17 13:09:35,871 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

    This function uses a standard method recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),
    which considers the first trimester ultrasound measurements to be the most accurate method to establish gestational age.

    Parameters:
    - cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
                           If cycle_length is more than 28, the difference is added to the 40-week period.
    - last_menstrual_period (str): The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

    Returns:
    - str: The estimated due date in the format 'Day, Month DD, YYYY'.

    Usage:
    The function is intended for use by healthcare providers to estimate due dates for pregnant patients,
    which can help in managing pregnancy timelines effectively and in planning medical care accordingly.

    Example:
    'Monday, Oct 16, 2023'
}}
Parameter List：
{{{
    "cycle_length": {"Value": 28, "Unit": "days"},
    "last_menstrual_period": {"Value": "2018/03/15", "Unit": null}
}}}
Step By Step Analysis:
Step 1: Analyzing parameter 'cycle_length'
Function Docstring:
- cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
                           If cycle_length is more than 28, the difference is added to the 40-week period.
Parameter List:
- Value: 28
- Unit: days
Analysis:
The unit 'days' matches the requirement in the Function Docstring.

Step 2: Analyzing parameter 'last_menstrual_period'
Function Docstring:
- last_menstrual_period (str): The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.
Parameter List:
- Value: "2018/03/15"
- Unit: null
Analysis:
The value format matches the requirement in the Function Docstring.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed."
}
