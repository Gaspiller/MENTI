2025-08-17 13:11:14,034 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks which tool is used to assess the severity of CAP (Community-Acquired Pneumonia).
2. The Task Scenario mentions a patient presenting with symptoms of pneumonia, including fever, cough, and lung abnormalities, which align with the context of assessing pneumonia severity.
3. The tools in the Tool List that are relevant for assessing the severity of CAP are the PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP and the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.
4. Considering the demand for assessing pneumonia severity and the patient's clinical presentation of pneumonia symptoms, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP. This tool is specifically designed to risk-stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia and determine the severity of pneumonia based on various clinical parameters.

2025-08-17 13:11:21,857 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

Parameters:
age (int): Patient's age in years.
sex (str): Patient's sex, either 'Female' or 'Male'.
nursing_home_resident (bool): True if the patient is a nursing home resident, False otherwise.
neoplastic_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of neoplastic disease, False otherwise.
liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of liver disease, False otherwise.
chf_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, False otherwise.
cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of cerebrovascular disease, False otherwise.
renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of renal disease, False otherwise.
altered_mental_status (bool): True if the patient has altered mental status, False otherwise.
respiratory_rate (bool): True if respiratory rate is ≥30 breaths/min, False otherwise.
systolic_bp (bool): True if systolic blood pressure is <90 mmHg, False otherwise.
temperature (bool): True if temperature is <35°C or >39.9°C, False otherwise.
pulse (bool): True if pulse rate is ≥125 beats/min, False otherwise.
blood_ph (bool): True if blood pH is <7.35, False otherwise.
bun (bool): True if BUN is ≥30 mg/dL or ≥11 mmol/L, False otherwise.
sodium (bool): True if sodium level is <130 mmol/L, False otherwise.
glucose (bool): True if glucose level is ≥250 mg/dL or ≥14 mmol/L, False otherwise.
hematocrit (bool): True if hematocrit is <30%, False otherwise.
oxygen_pressure (bool): True if partial pressure of oxygen is <60 mmHg or <8 kPa, False otherwise.
pleural_effusion (bool): True if there is pleural effusion on x-ray, False otherwise.

Returns:
int: The total PSI/PORT Score indicating the severity of the pneumonia.
