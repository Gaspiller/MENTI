2025-08-17 12:43:36,509 - INFO - 1. User Demand: The user is asking for a tool used to evaluate a patient's glomerular filtration rate.

2. Task Scenario Analysis: The scenario provided focuses on a patient presenting with findings suggestive of IgA nephropathy, including proteinuria, hematuria, and elevated serum creatinine levels indicating potential renal impairment. The evaluation of glomerular function is crucial in cases of kidney diseases like IgA nephropathy.

3. Matching Tool Analysis:
   - CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR): This tool specifically calculates the Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) using creatinine-based equations, making it suitable for assessing kidney function, which is essential in cases like IgA nephropathy where renal function needs to be evaluated.

Based on the user demand for evaluating a patient's glomerular filtration rate and the scenario involving kidney pathology like IgA nephropathy with impaired renal function, the most suitable tool from the list is the "CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)."

{{Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.
