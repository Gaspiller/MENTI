2025-08-17 13:08:24,940 - INFO - 1. User Demand: The user demand specifically asks for a tool used to assess the severity of depression in a patient. This aligns with the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) tool in the provided Tool List.

2. Task Scenario: The scenario describes a patient with symptoms of severe depression, including low mood, anxiety, insomnia, self-blame, and repetitive negative thoughts. It also mentions findings on head MRI indicating slight degenerative changes in bilateral frontal lobes, potentially related to depressive symptoms. The treatment response to antidepressants and symptomatic improvement further supports the diagnosis of major depressive episode. The scenario highlights possible functional impairments in emotional regulation, attention, and thinking, which are common features of severe depression.

2025-08-17 13:08:29,438 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.
