2025-08-17 13:00:05,842 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool that predicts the risk of major cardiac events in patients over the next 6 weeks.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with rheumatic heart disease, including mitral valve stenosis with moderate regurgitation and other cardiac issues leading to potential heart function impairment, arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, and heart block. The treatment plan involves medications targeting heart disease interventions like anticoagulation, vasodilation, and improving ventricular remodeling. Overall, the patient's condition significantly affects heart function and the overall circulatory system.

3. The tool that aligns most closely with predicting the risk of major cardiac events in the provided scenario is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events." This tool specifically calculates the risk assessment for acute coronary syndrome based on various factors like history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels, which are crucial in determining the risk of major cardiac events in the given patient with rheumatic heart disease.

Therefore, the chosen tool is the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events.

2025-08-17 13:00:11,433 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
