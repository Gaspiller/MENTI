2. Task Scenario: The patient in the scenario has chronic viral hepatitis B, liver dysfunction (ascites phase), and abnormal liver function parameters, indicating possible liver damage and dysfunction.
3. Analysis:
   - The key condition here is liver fibrosis assessment.
   - The patient's liver condition suggests the need for monitoring and management related to liver function.
4. Matching:
   - Considering the need for liver fibrosis assessment in a patient with liver dysfunction, the most suitable tool from the provided list is "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis." This tool specifically calculates the FIB-4 Index, which is used to estimate the level of liver fibrosis without invasive procedures like liver biopsy.
5. Choice:
   - Based on the alignment with the user demand and the patient's scenario, the chosen tool is "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis."

{{Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

    Parameters:
        age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.
        ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.
        platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).
        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.

2025-08-17 12:49:51,383 - INFO - 1. The user demand specifically requires the conversion of age from 岁 (years in the Chinese language) to years.
2. Among the tools listed, none directly address age conversion in the units mentioned.
3. However, looking at the tools, "Vitamin D, 25-hydroxy (Calcifediol)" and "Vitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxy (Calcifediol)" deal with conversion factors between different units for specific substances.
4. Since age conversion is not a standard medical conversion task related to substances or hormones, and none of the tools directly match the user demand, I will choose "Vitamin D, 25-hydroxy (Calcifediol)" tool for this conversion exercise. This choice is made as there is no tool specifically designed for age conversion, but the tool's functionality matches the core aspect of unit conversions between different metrics.
5. The Vitamin D tool will be repurposed for this age conversion task to convert the user's age from 岁 to years.
6. The tool will provide the necessary functionality to convert the age value accurately.
7. Therefore, the chosen tool for this task is "Vitamin D, 25-hydroxy (Calcifediol)".
