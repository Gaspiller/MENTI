2025-08-17 13:14:53,974 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool to assess the cardiac surgery risk before knee osteosynthesis surgery. This indicates a need to evaluate the patient's cardiac risk factors and potential complications related to heart function preoperatively. 

2. The tool that best aligns with this demand is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk." This tool is designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, which includes evaluating factors like congestive heart failure, history of ischemic heart disease, and other cardiac-related risk factors.

3. Considering the patient's history of hypertension, congestive heart failure, diabetes, and cardiovascular issues revealed on ECG and echocardiogram, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index is the most suitable tool to evaluate the cardiac surgery risk in this scenario.

2025-08-17 13:14:59,392 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
