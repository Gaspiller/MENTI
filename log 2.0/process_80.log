2025-08-17 13:15:17,558 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool that evaluates the postoperative cardiac risk in patients with preoperative coronary heart disease.
2. Given that the Task Scenario highlights a patient with unstable angina due to coronary heart disease and mentions the impact on cardiac function, it aligns with the preoperative evaluation of cardiac risk in such patients.
3. The tool that matches these criteria is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" from the Tool List.
4. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery and aids in preoperative risk stratification, which directly pertains to the postoperative cardiac risk evaluation specified in the User Demand and highlighted in the Task Scenario.

2025-08-17 13:15:24,408 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
