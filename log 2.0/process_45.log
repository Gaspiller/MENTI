2025-08-17 12:58:48,956 - INFO - 1. In the User Demand, the focus is on assessing the bleeding risk in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and determining the possibility of outpatient treatment. This aligns with the "Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)" tool from the Tool List, which is specifically designed to calculate the bleeding risk in adult patients with upper GI bleeding.

2. The Task Scenario emphasizes the presence of acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic shock, and severe anemia in the patient. These conditions directly correlate with the parameters assessed by the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score, such as hemoglobin level, blood pressure, heart rate, and presence of melena.

3. The Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score is used to stratify patients' condition based on the severity of bleeding and guide decisions regarding hospital admission. Given the critical state of the patient with upper GI bleeding, evaluating the bleeding risk using this tool can help in determining the need for hospitalization and appropriate management.

4. Considering the core medical intent and the keywords related to bleeding risk assessment in the User Demand and Task Scenario, the most suitable tool to choose is the "Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)".

2025-08-17 12:58:52,794 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.

Parameters:
- hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
- bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
- systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
- sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
- heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
- melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
- syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
- hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
- cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

Returns:
- int: Glasgow-Blatchford Score, ranging from 0 to 23.

Description:
This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.

Parameter List：
{{{
"hemoglobin": {"Value": 5.7, "Unit": "g/dL"},
"bun": {"Value": 15.41, "Unit": "mg/dL"},
"systolic_bp": {"Value": 83, "Unit": "mm Hg"},
"sex": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null},
"heart_rate": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null},

"syncope": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null},
"hepatic_disease": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null},
"cardiac_failure": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}
}}}
Step By Step Analysis:
hemoglobin (5.7 g/dL) - hemoglobin is specified in grams per deciliter (g/dL) in the Function Docstring.
bun (15.41 mg/dL) - BUN is specified in milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) in the Function Docstring.
systolic_bp (83 mm Hg) - Systolic blood pressure is specified in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) in the Function Docstring.

Final Answer:

{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use indices to specify units."
