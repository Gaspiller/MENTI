2025-08-17 13:00:34,558 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to predict the risk of major cardiac events in patients within 6 weeks. This aligns with the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events, which helps risk-stratify patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with third-degree atrioventricular block, indicating potential risks such as irregular heart rate and decreased cardiac function. While the scenario doesn't specifically mention chest pain, the focus on monitoring cardiac function and the need for a pacemaker aligns with the use of a cardiac risk assessment tool like the HEART Score.

3. Considering both the User Demand and the Task Scenario, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-17 13:00:42,969 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

}}}
Step By Step Analysis:
{{For the history_score:
    - From the Function Docstring, it requires an integer value representing the level of suspicion based on the patient's history, with three possible values (0, 1, 2).
    - The provided value in the Parameter List is 0, which is consistent with the requirements in the Docstring.
    
For the ekg_score:
    - From the Function Docstring, it requires an integer value representing EKG findings, with three possible values (0, 1, 2).
    - The provided value in the Parameter List is 1, which is consistent with the requirements in the Docstring.
    
For the age_score:
    - From the Function Docstring, it requires an integer value representing the patient's age group, with three possible values (0, 1, 2).
    - The provided value in the Parameter List is 1, which is consistent with the requirements in the Docstring.
    
For the risk_factors_score:
    - From the Function Docstring, it requires an integer value representing the number of cardiovascular risk factors, with three possible values (0, 1, 2).
    - The provided value in the Parameter List is 1, which is consistent with the requirements in the Docstring.
    
For the troponin_score:
    - From the Function Docstring, it requires an integer value representing the troponin levels, with three possible values (0, 1, 2).
    - The provided value in the Parameter List is 0, which is consistent with the requirements in the Docstring.
