2025-08-17 13:09:56,360 - INFO - 1. The User Demand explicitly asks for a tool used to assess the severity index of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in patients.
2. The Task Scenario highlights the diagnosis of pneumonia in the patient, indicating the relevance of assessing the severity of pneumonia.
3. Among the tools provided in the Tool List, the most suitable tool for evaluating the severity of pneumonia in the context of the User Demand and Task Scenario is the "PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP".
4. The PSI/PORT Score is specifically designed to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia, aligning perfectly with the User Demand and the patient's condition of having pneumonia.
5. The parameters required for calculating the PSI/PORT Score, such as age, respiratory rate, temperature, and other clinical factors, match the symptoms and characteristics mentioned in the Task Scenario.
6. Therefore, the "PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP" is the most appropriate tool to choose based on the User Demand and Task Scenario.

2025-08-17 13:10:06,520 - INFO - {{"Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
    It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    sex (str): Patient's sex, either 'Female' or 'Male'.
    nursing_home_resident (bool): True if the patient is a nursing home resident, False otherwise.
    neoplastic_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of neoplastic disease, False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of liver disease, False otherwise.
    chf_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, False otherwise.
    cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of cerebrovascular disease, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of renal disease, False otherwise.
    altered_mental_status (bool): True if the patient has altered mental status, False otherwise.
    respiratory_rate (bool): True if respiratory rate is ≥30 breaths/min, False otherwise.
    systolic_bp (bool): True if systolic blood pressure is <90 mmHg, False otherwise.
    temperature (bool): True if temperature is <35°C or >39.9°C, False otherwise.
    pulse (bool): True if pulse rate is ≥125 beats/min, False otherwise.
    blood_ph (bool): True if blood pH is <7.35, False otherwise.
    bun (bool): True if BUN is ≥30 mg/dL or ≥11 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    sodium (bool): True if sodium level is <130 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    glucose (bool): True if glucose level is ≥250 mg/dL or ≥14 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    hematocrit (bool): True if hematocrit is <30%, False otherwise.
    oxygen_pressure (bool): True if partial pressure of oxygen is <60 mmHg or <8 kPa, False otherwise.
    pleural_effusion (bool): True if there is pleural effusion on x-ray, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    int: The total PSI/PORT Score indicating the severity of the pneumonia."}}
