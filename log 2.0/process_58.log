2025-08-17 13:04:54,823 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to evaluate a patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP). In the Task Scenario, while there is mention of psychiatric symptoms in a patient with suspected intracranial infection, the core keyword related to the User Demand is "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)."

2. From the provided Tool List, the tool that aligns with the User Demand for evaluating Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)."

3. The Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) tool involves calculating the MAP based on systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings, which is an essential medical metric used in various clinical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, and stroke.

Based on the alignment with the core keyword "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" in the User Demand, the suitable tool choice is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator.

{{"Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333}}

Parameter Listï¼š
{{{"systolic_bp": {"Value": 90, "Unit": "mmHg"}, "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 60, "Unit": "mmHg"}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
1. Analyzing parameter 'systolic_bp':
    Function Docstring requirement: systolic_bp should be in mmHg.
    Parameter List value for systolic_bp: 90 mmHg
    Comparison: The unit is consistent. No unit conversion needed.

2. Analyzing parameter 'diastolic_bp':
    Function Docstring requirement: diastolic_bp should be in mmHg.
    Parameter List value for diastolic_bp: 60 mmHg
    Comparison: The unit is consistent. No unit conversion needed.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use indices to specify units."
}
