2025-08-17 13:19:35,777 - INFO - 1. User Demand Analysis:
   - The user demand is asking for a tool used to calculate the actual sodium levels in patients with hyperglycemia.
   - The demand specifically mentions high blood sugar levels, indicating a focus on correcting sodium levels in the presence of hyperglycemia.

2. Tool Analysis:
   - Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia:
     - This tool is specifically designed to calculate the corrected sodium level in patients with hyperglycemia.
     - It takes into account the osmotic shifts of water due to high glucose levels, providing an accurate correction for sodium levels in such patients.

3. Matching Analysis:
   - The demand clearly focuses on high blood sugar levels and the implications on sodium levels, aligning perfectly with the purpose of the Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia tool.
   - Given the patient scenario of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes with significant skin breakdown due to elevated glucose levels, the correction of sodium for hyperglycemia is crucial in managing the patient's condition.

Based on the detailed analysis, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List is "Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia".

2025-08-17 13:19:38,515 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Corrected Sodium for Hyperglycemia using Hillier's method from 1999.

This function computes the corrected sodium level in patients with hyperglycemia,
accounting for osmotic shifts of water from the intracellular to the extracellular space,
which can lead to dilutional hyponatremia. The formula uses a correction factor of 2.4 mEq/L
for every 100 mg/dL increase in serum glucose above the normal threshold of 100 mg/dL.

Parameters:
measured_sodium (float): The measured sodium level in mEq/L.
serum_glucose (float): The serum glucose level in mg/dL.

Returns:
float: The corrected sodium level in mEq/L.

Example:
sodium_correction_hyperglycemia(140, 200) = 142.4
Parameter List:
{"measured_sodium": {"Value": 140.0, "Unit": "mEq/L"}, "serum_glucose": {"Value": 190.97, "Unit": "mg/dL"}}

Step By Step Analysis:

Comparing measured_sodium:
Function Docstring specifies the unit for measured_sodium as mEq/L.
Parameter List provides a value of 140.0 with the unit mEq/L.
The units are consistent for measured_sodium. 

Comparing serum_glucose:
Function Docstring specifies the unit for serum_glucose as mg/dL.
Parameter List provides a value of 190.97 with the unit mg/dL.
The units are consistent for serum_glucose.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use indices to specify units."
