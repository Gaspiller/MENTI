You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估上消化道出血患者的出血程度和预后风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

Abnormal parts of the patient's case:
1. Upper gastrointestinal bleeding (digestive ulcer bleeding)
2. Moderate anemia
3. Unstable angina (coronary heart disease)
4. Hypertension (high-risk level 2)
5. Previous cerebral infarction

Speculated impaired bodily functions:
1. Impaired blood clotting mechanisms leading to upper gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia.
2. Impaired coronary blood flow and myocardial oxygen supply leading to unstable angina.
3. Impaired regulation of blood pressure leading to hypertension.
4. Impaired brain function resulting from the previous cerebral infarction.

    "Which scoring system is used to evaluate the severity of upper gastrointestinal bleeding in patients with digestive ulcer bleeding?",
    "What is the prognostic risk assessment tool used for patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and moderate anemia?",
    "Is there a specific scale to assess the risk of future bleeding episodes in patients with a history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding and anemia?"
