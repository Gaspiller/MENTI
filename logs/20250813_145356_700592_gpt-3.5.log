[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于计算高血糖患者的实际钠水平？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病史和辅助检查结果，患者被诊断为2型糖尿病并伴有糖尿病肾病和视网膜病变。主要表现为持续性高血糖，尿糖阳性，血糖波动，视物模糊，测量所得的血糖偏高。此外，辅助检查结果显示血糖测定异常，如血糖、糖化血红蛋白。综合分析，患者可能存在胰岛素抵抗或分泌缺陷，导致血糖控制不佳。

此外，患者的肾功能可能受损，出现糖尿病肾病的症状，如蛋白尿。视网膜病变可能是由于长期高血糖引起的，并可能导致视力问题。

总的来说，患者的胰岛素抵抗或分泌缺陷导致了2型糖尿病，同时肾脏和视网膜也受到了一定程度的损害。治疗以降糖、扩管为主，并对症支持治疗，有待长期密切观察和管理。
