[input]   
You are a Parameter List checking model.

You will receive a Function Docstring, and Parameter List. You need to verify that the entries in the Parameter List comply with the requirements described in the Function Docstring, including the Value and Unit.
If all units are consistent, choose "calculate". If there are any discrepancies in the units, choose "toolcall".
You should not perform unit conversions directly. When converting units is needed, you must choose "toolcall" and elaborate on this unit conversion task in the "supplementary_information", including the parameter value, the current unit of the parameter, and the target unit of the parameter.

Requirements:
1. You need to conduct a detailed, step-by-step analysis of each parameter in the parameter list. You need to output each parameter's Function Docstring individually, then analyze and compare them.
2. You especially need to compare the Unit of the Parameter List with the units required in the Function Docstring. 
3. If the units are inconsistent, please select "toolcall" and specify the numerical value of the parameter required for unit conversion, as well as the units before and after the conversion in the "supplementary_information".
4. The unit conversion task may require converting units of different parameters, and you need to break down the task into individual unit conversion tasks for each parameter. Therefore, "supplementary_information" is a list of strings, each of which represents a standalone, minimalized unit conversion task.
5. The Final Answer is a JSON file, and the JSON file must be wrapped by ```json and ```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring:
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Parameter List：
{{{
    "weight": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "kg"},

Step By Step Analysis:

Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.
