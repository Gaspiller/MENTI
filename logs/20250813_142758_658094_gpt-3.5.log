You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估肝硬化患者肝功能疾病严重程度和肝移植候选资格？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病例，患者主要患有乙型肝炎后肝硬化（失代偿期）和晚期HCC。根据血液检查结果显示白细胞和血小板计数偏低，同时肝功能指标如AST、ALT升高，胆红素增高，提示肝脏功能受损。其他指标如白蛋白、肿瘤标志物如AFP、PIVKA-Ⅱ也都异常升高，与肝硬化和HCC相关。肝脏影像学检查显示肝硬化、脾大、门静脉栓子形成等表现，进一步印证了肝功能的受损。最近出现的上消化道出血提示胆汁淤积、食管胃底静脉曲张等并发症，需要针对性治疗保护脏器功能。综上所述，患者可能存在肝功能不全、出血倾向以及脾大等问题，需要积极治疗并维持脏器功能。
