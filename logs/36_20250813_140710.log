   - Value: Randomly assign a value, let's say 2.

2. Parameter: control_worrying
   - Reference Text: The patient reported not being able to stop worrying and constantly talking about work unfairness and daily life issues.
   - Inference: The patient is exhibiting signs of inability to control worrying, making it likely that they have a higher score for this parameter.
   - Value: Randomly assign a value, let's say 3.

3. Parameter: worry_too_much
   - Reference Text: The patient is excessively talking about work unfairness and daily life issues, which can indicate a tendency to worry too much.
   - Inference: The patient is likely to have a higher score for worrying too much.
   - Value: Randomly assign a value, let's say 2.

4. Parameter: trouble_relaxing
   - Reference Text: The patient is described as having difficulty relaxing.
   - Inference: The patient experiences trouble relaxing, indicating a higher score for this parameter.
   - Value: Randomly assign a value, let's say 2.

5. Parameter: restlessness
   - Reference Text: The patient exhibited restlessness by being unable to sit still.
   - Inference: The patient experiences restlessness, suggesting a higher score for this parameter.
   - Value: Randomly assign a value, let's say 2.

6. Parameter: irritability
   - Reference Text: The patient is easily annoyed or irritable.
   - Inference: The patient shows signs of irritability and easily getting annoyed.
   - Value: Randomly assign a value, let's say 1.

7. Parameter: fear_of_awful_events
   - Reference Text: No direct mention of feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.
   - Inference: Given the overall presentation of symptoms including delusions, impulsivity, and aggression, it can be inferred that the patient may have some fear of awful events.
   - Value: Randomly assign a value, let's say 1.

2025-08-13 14:07:45,794 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
    based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
    frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
    2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

    This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
    including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
    It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
    to assess and monitor treatment responses.

    Parameters:
    - nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
    - control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
    - worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
    - trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
    - restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
    - irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
    - fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

    Returns:
    int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

    Usage Example:
    gad_7_score = calculate_gad_7(3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
    print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score
