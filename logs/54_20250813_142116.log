2. 根据用户需求，适合用于预测心脏患者发生重大心脏事件风险的工具是"HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"。该工具可以根据患者的病史、心电图结果、年龄、危险因素和肌钙蛋白水平来评估患者的急性冠状动脉综合征(ACS)风险。

3. 因此，最适合的工具是"HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"。

2025-08-13 14:21:41,093 - INFO - 1. Determine the history_score parameter:
   - From the reference text, the patient has a history of chest pain for 13 days with worsening for the last 3 days. The description indicates that there is a history of acute myocardial infarction. This would classify as "Highly suspicious," so the history_score value would be 2.

2. Determine the ekg_score parameter:
   - The EKG findings mention ST segment depression and T wave inversion in certain leads, indicating abnormal findings. This corresponds to "Significant ST deviation," so the ekg_score value would be 2.

3. Determine the age_score parameter:
   - The reference text mentions that the patient is a 72-year-old male. This falls into the age category of "65 or older," so the age_score value would be 2.

4. Determine the risk_factors_score parameter:
   - From the past medical history provided in the reference text, the patient has a history of hypertension for over 20 years, type 2 diabetes for 2 years, and a previous stroke. These are significant cardiovascular risk factors, so the risk_factors_score value would be 2.

5. Determine the troponin_score parameter:
   - The troponin level mentioned in the reference text is 5.18ng/ml, which is greater than 3 times the normal limit. Therefore, the troponin_score value would be 2.

2025-08-13 14:21:48,459 - INFO - {{Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on the number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
