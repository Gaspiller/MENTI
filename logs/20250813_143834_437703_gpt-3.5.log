    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
    - history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:

HOMA-IR (Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance): Calculate the Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR).

    The HOMA-IR is a clinical tool used to estimate insulin resistance (IR), which can be
    indicative of potential glucose intolerance and diabetes. It is particularly useful
    in scenarios where more invasive and time-consuming methods like the clamp measurement
    (considered the gold standard for measuring IR) are not feasible. Although the HOMA-IR
    provides a reasonable correlation with clamp measurements, it is less accurate on an
    individual basis, which suggests a need for caution in its clinical application and
    interpretation.

    Parameters:
    - fasting_insulin (float): The fasting insulin level in uIU/mL.
    - fasting_glucose (float): The fasting glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated insulin resistance (HOMA-IR score).

    Formula:
    HOMA-IR score = (fasting insulin * fasting glucose) / 405

    chronic kidney disease, urinary tract obstruction, or acute glomerular disease.
    
    Parameters:
    serum_creatinine (float): Serum creatinine concentration (mg/dL)
    urine_sodium (float): Urine sodium concentration (mmol/L)
    serum_sodium (float): Serum sodium concentration (mmol/L)
    urine_creatinine (float): Urine creatinine concentration (mg/dL)
    
    Returns:
    float: The Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa) in percentage
    
    Note:
    FENa is calculated using the formula:
    FENa (%) = 100 × (serum_creatinine × urine_sodium) / (serum_sodium × urine_creatinine)

Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

    Parameters:
        age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.
        ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.
