You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis', 'Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity', 'CIWA-Ar for Alcohol Withdrawal', 'Calcium Correction for Hypoalbuminemia', 'MELD Na (UNOS/OPTN)', 'PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis: Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

    Parameters:
        age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.
        ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.
        platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).
        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.


Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality: Calculate the Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality.

    increased accuracy in prognosis.

    Parameters:
    - bilirubin (float): Total bilirubin level in mg/dL.
    - albumin (float): Albumin level in g/dL.
    - inr (float): International Normalized Ratio.

    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.

    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.

    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表用于评估乙肝肝硬化失代偿期患者肝硬化的严重程度？}}
Task Scenario: {{Based on the provided patient's case, the main abnormalities include severe hepatitis, chronic hepatitis B, decompensated cirrhosis due to hepatitis B, acute peritonitis, chronic cholecystitis, and bilateral kidney stones. The patient presents with jaundice, abdominal distension, decreased urine output, fatigue, poor appetite, and lower limb edema. Additionally, the patient has elevated levels of serum bilirubin, liver enzymes, prolonged prothrombin time, and elevated white blood cell count, indicative of liver dysfunction and inflammation.

Possible impaired bodily functions include liver function, coagulation function, immune response, and kidney function due to the presence of multiple complications related to hepatitis B and liver cirrhosis. The presence of ascites also indicates potential impairment in fluid balance and possibly renal function. Further monitoring and management of liver-related complications are crucial for the patient's overall health and well-being.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Based on the user demand for assessing the severity of liver fibrosis in patients with decompensated cirrhosis due to hepatitis B, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "Child-Pugh Score for Cirrhosis Mortality."

2. The Child-Pugh Score is specifically designed to estimate the prognosis and severity of liver cirrhosis, making it the ideal choice for evaluating the liver disease in the provided patient with decompensated cirrhosis.

3. The tool takes into account parameters such as bilirubin level, albumin level, INR, presence of ascites, and grade of hepatic encephalopathy to calculate a score ranging from 5 (best) to 15 (worst), reflecting the severity of cirrhosis and predicting mortality.

4. Given the patient's presentation with jaundice, abdominal distension, and other symptoms indicating liver dysfunction, the Child-Pugh Score will provide valuable insights into the severity of liver disease and aid in determining the appropriate management and treatment strategies.
