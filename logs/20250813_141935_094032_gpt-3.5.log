You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk', 'ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications', 'Corrected QT Interval (QTc)', 'Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease', 'Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events:  Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)

Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk: Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
 

ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications: Calculate the ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications.
    This score helps predict the risk of pulmonary complications in patients undergoing surgery under general, neuraxial, or regional anesthesia.

Corrected QT Interval (QTc): Calculate the Corrected QT Interval (QTc) for a patient.

    The QTc is used primarily to assess the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, especially torsades de pointes, 
    in patients with syncope or those receiving multiple QT-prolonging medications. A prolonged QT interval 
    can indicate a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This function corrects the QT interval to a heart rate 
    of 60 beats per minute, accounting for variations due to different heart rates.

    Parameters:

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.

User Demand: {{哪一个量表被用于预测患者在接受冠状动脉造影术+左心导管术后6周内发生重大心脏不良事件的风险？}}
Task Scenario: {{Analysis:
1. The patient has a history of X syndrome, acute bronchitis, peptic ulcer, post-traumatic brain sequelae, and chronic otitis media.
2. Presenting symptoms include recurrent dyspnea, chest tightness, and recent onset of headache.
3. The patient's past medical history includes hypertension, chronic otitis media, traumatic brain injury, and nerve damage in the left arm.
4. The physical examination shows normal vital signs, normal heart sounds, clear lung sounds, and no abdominal tenderness or swelling.
5. The patient's electrocardiogram is normal.

Speculated Impairments:
1. Impairment in cardiovascular system due to the history of X syndrome, acute bronchitis, peptic ulcer, and chest tightness, with the need for coronary angiography and left heart catheterization.
2. Possible neurological impairment from the post-traumatic brain sequelae and nerve damage in the left arm.

Further investigation and monitoring of cardiovascular and neurological functions are recommended for this patient.}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Based on the User Demand, the tool that predicts the risk of major cardiac events within 6 weeks post-coronary angiography and left heart catheterization is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events".

2. The HEART Score assesses the risk of acute coronary syndrome based on parameters such as history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels.

3. Given the patient's symptoms, past medical history, physical examination findings, and normal electrocardiogram, the HEART Score can help risk-stratify the patient into low, moderate, or high-risk categories for major cardiac events.

4. By calculating the HEART Score for this patient, healthcare providers can better manage and monitor the patient's cardiovascular health post-procedure.
