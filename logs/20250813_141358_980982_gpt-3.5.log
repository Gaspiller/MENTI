You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:
The main abnormal parts of the patient's case include gastric cancer with bleeding, iron deficiency anemia, small renal stones in the left kidney, hyperlipidemia, and carotid atherosclerosis. The patient presented with fatigue for 3 days and black stools for 1 day, with a drop in hemoglobin levels indicating digestive tract bleeding. The presence of iron deficiency anemia, confirmed by low hemoglobin and low serum iron levels, further supports the diagnosis. The gastric cancer and bleeding are evidenced by the findings on abdominal CT and gastroscopy showing a large irregular mass in the gastric antrum. The presence of small renal stones in the left kidney may indicate impaired kidney function, although it is not the primary concern in this case. The patient's history of hyperlipidemia and carotid atherosclerosis suggests cardiovascular risk factors. Treatment included acid suppression, fluid replacement, iron supplementation, and a partial gastrectomy for the gastric cancer. Further surgical intervention was necessary for the patient's condition.
