[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于估算患者的预产期？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病历提供的信息，患者停经25+6周发现胎死宫内，经过检查发现胎儿心脏结构异常，包括室间隔缺损、三尖瓣反流、主动脉弓发育不良等情况。这些心脏发育异常可能导致胎儿心脏功能受损，最终导致胎儿死亡。因此，可以推断患者怀孕期间胎儿可能存在心脏功能方面的重大异常，导致胎死宫内的结果。
