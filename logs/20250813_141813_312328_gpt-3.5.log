[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于预测患者在接下来的6周内发生重大心脏不良事件的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病情描述和检查结果，患者被诊断为风湿性心脏病，主要表现为二尖瓣轻度狭窄伴中度关闭不全。根据心脏彩超和动态心电图结果，患者还存在主动脉瓣狭窄伴关闭不全、室间隔轻度增厚、三尖瓣大量反流等问题。此外，患者还出现了心房颤动合并三度房室传导阻滞的情况。这些病症表明患者的心脏功能受损，可能导致心脏泵血功能下降，导致血液循环不畅，进一步影响全身各器官的供血和功能。综合治疗方案中的药物治疗和手术建议，应该是为了改善心脏功能和预防进一步加重心脏的病情。
