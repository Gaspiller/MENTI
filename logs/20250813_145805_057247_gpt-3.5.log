[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估手术前患者的心脏风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病史和辅助检查结果显示，患者主要出现了急性药物中毒（灭鼠药）和右前胸腹部刀刺伤所致的肝挫裂伤、腹腔积液和失血性贫血。这些病理情况表明患者可能存在肝功能受损，导致肝挫裂伤和腹腔积液，以及失血所致的贫血。肝在体内扮演着重要的代谢和排毒功能，因此肝功能受损可能影响到多个身体功能，包括消化、代谢和血液净化等。治疗方案中的血必净注射液也提示了患者存在失血性贫血的情况。综合病情分析，需要重点关注患者肝功能的持续恢复和血液的修复，以减轻对其他器官功能的影响。
