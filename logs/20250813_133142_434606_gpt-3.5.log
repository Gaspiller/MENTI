[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于估算慢性肾炎患者的肾小球滤过率（GFR）？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和辅助检查结果，可以确定患者患有慢性肾盂肾炎。该疾病表现为腰部酸痛、尿频、尿急和尿痛等症状，且尿常规检查显示白细胞增多、肾功能指标异常。B超检查显示右侧肾盂分离和输尿管扩张，这说明患者的肾脏功能受损，可能会影响尿液排出和肾脏对废物物质的处理能力。因此，患者可能出现尿液潴留和毒素堆积等问题，需要密切监测肾功能，并进行相应的治疗以改善肾脏功能。
