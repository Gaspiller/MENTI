[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的平均动脉压（MAP）？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和临床表现，可以看出患者患有冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病、心功能不全和高血压病。主要症状包括反复胸闷心慌，活动后明显，伴下肢浮肿等。辅助检查显示心影稍大和心电图显示st-t改变。这些都表明患者可能存在心脏功能异常，冠状动脉供血不足，血压异常等问题，可能会导致心脏功能减退、气短、心力衰竭等。治疗方案中给予心酰胺改善心功能等措施有助于改善病情。
