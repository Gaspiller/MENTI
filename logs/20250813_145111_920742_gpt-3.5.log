[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于计算高血糖患者的实际钠水平？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病历显示，患者主诉口干、口渴13年，13年前被诊断为2型糖尿病，目前血糖控制不佳，双侧胫腓骨中下段前侧皮肤破溃。辅助检查显示空腹血糖偏高，入院时为10.6mmol/L。这些症状表明可能存在糖尿病并发症，如神经病变和血管病变，可能导致皮肤破溃，同时也可能影响了患者的血糖控制。建议进一步检查神经功能和心血管健康状况，以寻找潜在的并发症并进行相应的治疗。
