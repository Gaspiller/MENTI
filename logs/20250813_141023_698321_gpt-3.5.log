You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Reference Text:
{{The patient is a 16-year-old male, 175cm in height and 65kg in weight}}

Function Docstring: 
{{Calculate the CIWA-Ar scale score for assessing alcohol withdrawal severity.

    The CIWA-Ar scale is intended for use in various medical settings where alcohol withdrawal is suspected.
    This tool helps in quantifying the severity of alcohol withdrawal through several symptom dimensions,
    each scored independently. The cumulative score helps guide clinical decisions regarding the necessity
    and intensity of treatment for withdrawal.

        - 1: Mildly anxious
        - 2-3: Moderate anxiety
        - 4: Moderately anxious, or guarded, so anxiety is inferred
        - 5-6: Severe anxiety, similar to panic states
        - 7: Equivalent to acute panic states as seen in severe delirium or acute schizophrenic reactions
    agitation (int): Index for agitation level. Range: 0-7.
        - 0: Normal activity
        - 1: Somewhat more activity than normal

Reference Text:
{{The loc_alertness value of 3 does not match the allowed values in the Function Docstring. It needs to be in the range [0, 2]}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  Step By Step Analysis:
1. nausea_vomiting:
   In the reference text, there is no specific mention of nausea or vomiting. We will infer a value based on the absence of these symptoms, so we will assign:
   - Value: 0

2. tremor:
   There is no information about tremors in the reference text, so we will assume the absence of tremors.
   - Value: 0

3. paroxysmal_sweats:
   The reference text does not provide information about sweating symptoms, so we will assume the absence of significant sweating.
   - Value: 0

4. anxiety:
   The reference text does not mention anxiety levels, so we will consider a low level of anxiety.
   - Value: 1

5. agitation:
   As per the reference text, we do not have any indication of agitation. We will assign a minimal value for agitation.
   - Value: 0

6. tactile_disturbances:
   There is no mention of tactile disturbances in the reference text, so we will assume there are none.
   - Value: 0

7. visual_disturbances:
   Similar to tactile disturbances, no information is provided about visual disturbances in the reference text. Hence, we will assume minimal visual disturbances.
   - Value: 0

8. headache_fullness:
   The reference text does not specify any headache or fullness in the head symptoms. Therefore, we will assume no significant headache.
   - Value: 0

9. orientation_sensorium:
   The reference text talks about a mismatch in the loc_alertness value, but this parameter is not defined in the Function Docstring. Since there is no direct relation to orientation or clouding of sensorium, we will randomly assign a value for this parameter based on the given ranges in the Function Docstring.
   - Value: 2
