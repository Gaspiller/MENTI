2025-08-13 14:44:03,090 - INFO - 1. Based on the User Demand, we need to choose a tool from the Tool List that assesses the postoperative cardiac risk in preoperative coronary heart disease patients.

2. The tool that aligns with this requirement is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

3. The "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" calculates the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, which includes assessing the risk factors associated with coronary heart disease patients.

4. Given the patient's history of unstable angina and suspected acute coronary syndrome, evaluating the preoperative cardiac risk using the Revised Cardiac Risk Index can provide valuable information for managing the patient's cardiovascular condition during and after surgery.

5. Therefore, the chosen tool based on the User Demand and the Task Scenario is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

The Final Answer:

2025-08-13 14:44:10,566 - INFO - 1. Parameter: elevated_risk_surgery
   Reference Text: The patient's medical history includes a diagnosis of unstable angina due to coronary heart disease.
   Analysis: Unstable angina due to coronary heart disease indicates a high risk of major cardiac complications, which is consistent with the criteria for elevated risk surgery in the function docstring.
   Value: True

2. Parameter: history_of_ischemic_heart_disease
   Reference Text: The patient has a history of unstable angina due to coronary heart disease.
   Analysis: Unstable angina due to coronary heart disease indicates a history of ischemic heart disease, which aligns with the criteria for this parameter in the function docstring.
   Value: True

3. Parameter: history_of_congestive_heart_failure
   Reference Text: The patient's clinical diagnosis includes unstable angina due to coronary heart disease.
   Analysis: The clinical diagnosis of unstable angina due to coronary heart disease does not directly indicate congestive heart failure. However, unstable angina is a serious heart condition that may be associated with heart failure. Considering the complexity of the patient's cardiac issues, it is reasonable to infer a history of congestive heart failure.
   Value: True

4. Parameter: history_of_cerebrovascular_disease
   Reference Text: The patient's past medical history does not include cerebrovascular disease.
   Analysis: The absence of cerebrovascular disease in the patient's medical history indicates no history of stroke or transient ischemic attack, which aligns with the criteria in the function docstring.
   Value: False

5. Parameter: preop_treatment_with_insulin
   Reference Text: The patient's past medical history does not mention preoperative insulin treatment.
   Analysis: There is no mention of preoperative insulin treatment in the patient's medical history, indicating that the patient is not being treated with insulin preoperatively.
   Value: False

6. Parameter: preop_creatinine_above_threshold
   Reference Text: The patient's serum creatinine level is reported as 1.5mg/dL.
   Analysis: The patient's serum creatinine level is below the threshold specified in the function docstring for this parameter.
   Value: False

2025-08-13 14:44:19,782 - INFO - {{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
