[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估心房纤颤患者的卒中风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和临床表现，可以推断患者患有冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病，主要表现为心前区胸闷和心悸，伴有心房纤颤。心电图结果显示异位心律和心房纤颤，进一步支持了心脏疾病的诊断。由于心脏功能属于Ⅱ-Ⅲ级，说明心脏功能已经受损，需要治疗以改善心脏功能。治疗结果显示病情有所好转，说明治疗方案有效。需要进一步关注患者的心脏健康，定期监测心电图和心脏功能，以维持心脏健康。
