You are a Parameter List checking model.

You will receive a Function Docstring, and Parameter List. You need to verify that the entries in the Parameter List comply with the requirements described in the Function Docstring, including the Value and Unit.
If all units are consistent, choose "calculate". If there are any discrepancies in the units, choose "toolcall".
You should not perform unit conversions directly. When converting units is needed, you must choose "toolcall" and elaborate on this unit conversion task in the "supplementary_information", including the parameter value, the current unit of the parameter, and the target unit of the parameter.

Requirements:
1. You need to conduct a detailed, step-by-step analysis of each parameter in the parameter list. You need to output each parameter's Function Docstring individually, then analyze and compare them.
2. You especially need to compare the Unit of the Parameter List with the units required in the Function Docstring. 
3. If the units are inconsistent, please select "toolcall" and specify the numerical value of the parameter required for unit conversion, as well as the units before and after the conversion in the "supplementary_information".
4. The unit conversion task may require converting units of different parameters, and you need to break down the task into individual unit conversion tasks for each parameter. Therefore, "supplementary_information" is a list of strings, each of which represents a standalone, minimalized unit conversion task.
5. The Final Answer is a JSON file, and the JSON file must be wrapped by ```json and ```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring:
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Parameter List：
{{{
    "weight": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "kg"},

Step By Step Analysis:

Final Answer:
```json

    "supplementary_information": ["The height is 1.75m. The height needs to be converted from meters to centimeters."]
}

Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Corrected Sodium for Hyperglycemia using Hillier's method from 1999.

    This function computes the corrected sodium level in patients with hyperglycemia,
    accounting for osmotic shifts of water from the intracellular to the extracellular space,
    which can lead to dilutional hyponatremia. The formula uses a correction factor of 2.4 mEq/L
    for every 100 mg/dL increase in serum glucose above the normal threshold of 100 mg/dL.

    Parameters:
        measured_sodium (float): The measured sodium level in mEq/L.
        serum_glucose (float): The serum glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
        float: The corrected sodium level in mEq/L.

    Example:
        >>> sodium_correction_hyperglycemia(140, 200)
        142.4}}
Parameter List：{{{
    "measured_sodium": {"Value": 142, "Unit": "mmol/L"},
    "serum_glucose": {"Value": 337.62, "Unit": "mg/dL"}
}}}
Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  Parameter 1 - measured_sodium:
Function Docstring:
Calculate the Corrected Sodium for Hyperglycemia using Hillier's method from 1999.

Parameters:
measured_sodium (float): The measured sodium level in mEq/L.
serum_glucose (float): The serum glucose level in mg/dL.

Returns:
float: The corrected sodium level in mEq/L.

Parameter List:
Value: 142
Unit: mmol/L

Analysis:
The unit of measured_sodium in the Parameter List is mmol/L, while the Function Docstring requires the unit to be in mEq/L. Therefore, a unit conversion from mmol/L to mEq/L is needed. 
Supplementary Information:
The measured_sodium is 142 mmol/L. It needs to be converted from mmol/L to mEq/L.

Parameter 2 - serum_glucose:
Function Docstring:
Calculate the Corrected Sodium for Hyperglycemia using Hillier's method from 1999.

Parameters:
measured_sodium (float): The measured sodium level in mEq/L.
serum_glucose (float): The serum glucose level in mg/dL.

Returns:
float: The corrected sodium level in mEq/L.

Parameter List:
Value: 337.62
Unit: mg/dL

Analysis:
The unit of serum_glucose in the Parameter List is mg/dL, which is consistent with the Function Docstring requirement.
Supplementary Information:
No unit conversion is needed as the serum_glucose is already in mg/dL.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "toolcall",
    "supplementary_information": ["The measured_sodium is 142 mmol/L. It needs to be converted from mmol/L to mEq/L."]
}
