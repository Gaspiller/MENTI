2025-08-13 14:09:12,066 - INFO - Step By Step Analysis:
1. The parameter "eye_response" in the Function Docstring requires a score for eye response, which can be 4, 3, 2, or 1. The Reference Text does not provide a clear score for eye response. Based on the patient's clinical presentation as described in the Reference Text, which includes being unresponsive and with closed eyes, we can infer that the appropriate score for eye response is 1 (none).

2. The parameter "verbal_response" in the Function Docstring requires a score for verbal response, which can be 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1. The Reference Text does not specify the verbal response score. However, it mentions that the patient cannot speak and is uncooperative. Based on this information, we can infer that the verbal response score is 1 (no verbal response).

3. The parameter "motor_response" in the Function Docstring requires a score for motor response, which can be 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1. Since the Reference Text does not explicitly mention the patient's motor response, we can assume that the score is not testable (NT).

Parameters List:
```json
{
    "eye_response": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"},
    "verbal_response": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"},
    "motor_response": {"Value": "NT", "Unit": "null"}
}

2025-08-13 14:09:16,604 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculates the Glasgow Coma Scale/Score (GCS) based on the assessment of three key responses:
    eye, verbal, and motor. The GCS is used to assess the level of consciousness in patients who are
    in a coma due to medical or surgical causes and is applicable in various settings including
    pre-hospital, acute care, and research.

    The scale is particularly important for monitoring trends in a patient's mental status,
    facilitating communication between healthcare providers, and aiding in decisions regarding
    patient management.

    Parameters:
    eye_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for eye response
    verbal_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for verbal response
    motor_response (int or str): Score or 'NT' (not testable) for motor response

    Returns:
    int or None: Total GCS score if all components are testable, otherwise None

    Notes:
    - Scores for each component:
      * Eye:    4 (spontaneous), 3 (to verbal command), 2 (to pain), 1 (none)
      * Verbal: 5 (oriented), 4 (confused), 3 (inappropriate words),
                2 (incomprehensible sounds), 1 (no verbal response)
      * Motor:  6 (obeys commands), 5 (localizes pain), 4 (withdrawal from pain),
                3 (flexion to pain), 2 (extension to pain), 1 (no motor response)
    - If any component is 'NT' (not testable), the function returns None to indicate that
      the GCS cannot be fully assessed.}}

Parameter List：
{{{
    "eye_response": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"},
    "verbal_response": {"Value": 1, "Unit": "null"},
    "motor_response": {"Value": "NT", "Unit": "null"}
}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
1. eye_response:
   Function Docstring states that it can take an integer score or 'NT' for not testable.
   Parameter List provides a value of 1, which is consistent with the requirements of the Function Docstring.

2. verbal_response:
   Function Docstring states it can take an integer score or 'NT'.
   Parameter List provides a value of 1, which aligns with the Function Docstring requirements.

3. motor_response:
   Function Docstring allows 'NT' for not testable.
   Parameter List provides 'NT', which is in line with the Function Docstring specifications.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed."
}
