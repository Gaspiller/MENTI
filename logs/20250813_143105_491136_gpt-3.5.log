[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 孕期预产期计算器可用于推算预产期，基于什么信息？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和临床情况，可以看出患者出现了胎膜早破的情况。这可能导致羊水过早破裂，增加感染的风险，并且可能影响胎儿的健康。

此外，胎儿脐带被发现绕颈一周，也可能导致胎儿缺氧和其他并发症。

因此，患者的胎膜早破和脐带绕颈情况可能影响胎儿的供氧和保护，需要及时干预和监测以确保母婴安全。
