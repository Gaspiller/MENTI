[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于预测心脏患者在接下来6周内发生重大心脏不良事件的风险？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和临床表现，可以推断患者患有急性心肌梗死。这可能导致心脏的部分肌肉组织因血液供应不足而受损，影响心脏的正常收缩和泵血功能。在辅助检查中，心电图显示T波倒置和ST段压低，以及超敏肌钙蛋白I升高可进一步支持这一诊断。此外，冠脉CTA显示冠状动脉多发钙化及管腔狭窄，说明存在冠状动脉疾病，可能是导致急性心肌梗死的潜在原因之一。治疗重点应该是对心血管系统进行综合管理，包括抗血小板、抗凝、扩血管和降压等治疗措施。
