You are a dispatching model. Your task is to choose the most suitable tool from the tool list based on User Demand and the Task Scenario, which will then be provided to the user for use.

Tool List: {{['HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events', 'Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score', 'Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk', 'APACHE II Score', 'HAS-BLED Score for Major Bleeding Risk', 'Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)', 'ARISCAT Score for Postoperative Pulmonary Complications', 'MELD Na (UNOS/OPTN)', 'CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk', 'STOP-BANG Score for Obstructive Sleep Apnea']}}
Detailed information of each tool: {{HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events:  Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:

    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
