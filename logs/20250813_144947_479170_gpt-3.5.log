[input]   
You are a Parameter List checking model.

You will receive a Function Docstring, and Parameter List. You need to verify that the entries in the Parameter List comply with the requirements described in the Function Docstring, including the Value and Unit.
If all units are consistent, choose "calculate". If there are any discrepancies in the units, choose "toolcall".
You should not perform unit conversions directly. When converting units is needed, you must choose "toolcall" and elaborate on this unit conversion task in the "supplementary_information", including the parameter value, the current unit of the parameter, and the target unit of the parameter.

Requirements:
1. You need to conduct a detailed, step-by-step analysis of each parameter in the parameter list. You need to output each parameter's Function Docstring individually, then analyze and compare them.
2. You especially need to compare the Unit of the Parameter List with the units required in the Function Docstring. 
3. If the units are inconsistent, please select "toolcall" and specify the numerical value of the parameter required for unit conversion, as well as the units before and after the conversion in the "supplementary_information".
4. The unit conversion task may require converting units of different parameters, and you need to break down the task into individual unit conversion tasks for each parameter. Therefore, "supplementary_information" is a list of strings, each of which represents a standalone, minimalized unit conversion task.
5. The Final Answer is a JSON file, and the JSON file must be wrapped by ```json and ```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring:
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}
Parameter List：
{{{
    "weight": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "kg"},
    "height": {"Value": 1.75, "Unit": "m"}
}}}
Step By Step Analysis:
{{(Here is your step-by-step analysis. You need to ouptput the corresponding Function Docstring first for each parameter, and systematically compare each parameter with the corresponding information in the Parameter List and Function Docstring.)}}
Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "toolcall",
    "supplementary_information": ["The height is 1.75m. The height needs to be converted from meters to centimeters."]
}
```

Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Corrected Sodium for Hyperglycemia using Hillier's method from 1999.

Parameters:
 measured_sodium (float): The measured sodium level in mEq/L.
 serum_glucose (float): The serum glucose level in mg/dL.

Returns:
 float: The corrected sodium level in mEq/L.

}}
Parameter List：
{{{
    "measured_sodium": {"Value": 140, "Unit": "mmol/L"},
    "serum_glucose": {"Value": 80, "Unit": "mmol/L"}
}}}
Step By Step Analysis:
{{(Here is your step-by-step analysis. You need to ouptput the corresponding Function Docstring first for each parameter, and systematically compare each parameter with the corresponding information in the Parameter List and Function Docstring.)}}
Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "toolcall",
    "supplementary_information": ["The measured_sodium is 140 mmol/L. It needs to be converted from mmol/L to mEq/L.", "The serum_glucose is 80 mmol/L. It needs to be converted from mmol/L to mg/dL."]

Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
