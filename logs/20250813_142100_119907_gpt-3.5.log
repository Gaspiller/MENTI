You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}

Function Docstring: 
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. history_score:
Since the Reference Text does not mention any specific historical information related to the patient's chest pain or cardiac events, we need to infer this score based on the general demographic information provided. The patient is a 37-year-old female, and she has a medical history of congenital heart disease with atrial septal defect and mild tricuspid regurgitation. Given these conditions, we can infer that the history_score for this patient would be "2" (Highly suspicious) based on the severity and complexity of the existing cardiac conditions.

2. ekg_score:
The Reference Text does not provide direct information on the patient's EKG findings. However, it mentions that the electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a sinus rhythm with incomplete right bundle branch block and T-wave abnormalities in leads II, III, aVF, V3, V4. Based on these findings, we can infer that the ekg_score for this patient would be "2" (Significant ST deviation), as T-wave abnormalities can indicate myocardial ischemia or damage.

3. age_score:
The patient's age is explicitly mentioned in the Reference Text as 37 years old. According to the age categories defined in the function docstring, the age_score for this patient would be "1" (between 45 and 64 years).

4. risk_factors_score:
Although the Reference Text does not provide explicit information about the number of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in the patient, we can consider the presence of congenital heart disease, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and cardiomegaly as significant cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, we can infer that the risk_factors_score for this patient would be "2" (3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease).

5. troponin_score:
The Reference Text mentions that the patient's cardiac troponin levels are within the normal range (1-3 times normal limit), indicating no significant myocardial damage or injury. Therefore, the troponin_score for this patient would be "0" (≤ normal limit).

Parameters List:
```json
{
    "history_score": {"Value": 2},
    "ekg_score": {"Value": 2},
    "age_score": {"Value": 1},
    "risk_factors_score": {"Value": 2},
    "troponin_score": {"Value": 0}
}
