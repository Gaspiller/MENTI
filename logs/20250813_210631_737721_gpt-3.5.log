[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估ICU患者的严重程度和预测死亡率？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和临床表现，主要的异常部分是蛛网膜下隙出血。这可能导致患者出现意识模糊、失语、瞳孔对光反射迟钝、肌力减弱等症状。此外，患者还有前交通动脉瘤破裂、肺部感染、高血压病等并发症，可能会影响血液循环和呼吸功能。治疗方案中包括抗炎、止血、脱水等支持性治疗，有助于控制病情。需要密切监测患者的神经状态、血压、血氧饱和度等指标，以及及时调整治疗方案。
