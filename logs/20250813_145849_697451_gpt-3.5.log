[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者肺炎的严重程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据提供的病史，患者主要症状为咳嗽、咳痰、伴随胸痛，胸CT显示双侧支气管扩张伴肺病感染。此外，患者的心电图显示心律不齐，心肌缺血。辅助检查中BUN值偏低，表明可能存在肾功能异常。

结论：患者可能存在支气管扩张伴肺病感染、心律不齐、心肌缺血和肾功能异常等问题。进一步检查和治疗可能需要针对这些方面展开。
