You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估患者的肝纤维化程度？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者病史和辅助检查结果，可以得出以下分析：

1. 右肾囊肿：患者主诉右腰部胀痛，经B超检查提示右肾囊肿，需要手术治疗。右肾囊肿可能导致肾功能受损，如影响尿液排泄和水电解质平衡。

2. 慢性病毒性乙型肝炎及肝功能不全：患者被诊断为慢性病毒性乙型肝炎和肝功能不全，表现为肝功能指标异常，如TBIL、DBIL、ALT、AST等数值增高或减低。肝功能不全可能导致蛋白质代谢紊乱、凝血功能异常等问题。

根据病情好转的治疗结果，可以初步推断患者在右肾囊肿手术和肝功能不全治疗后有明显改善。需要继续密切监测肾脏功能和肝功能，以确保病情稳定。
