[output]  Analysis:
1. The patient presented with a history of a positive urine HCG test after a 40-day menstrual delay, indicating a possible pregnancy. This was further confirmed by the presence of fetal movement and a positive result for 21-trisomy syndrome in the umbilical cord blood test.
2. The decision to induce labor was made due to the high-risk factor of 21-trisomy syndrome in the fetus.
3. The patient did not report any significant abdominal pain, vaginal bleeding, headaches, dizziness, or other alarming symptoms during the pregnancy period.
4. The patient denied a history of chronic diseases, surgeries, traumas, or blood transfusions.

Impaired bodily functions:
Based on the provided information, the main impairment could be in the genetic makeup of the fetus, leading to the diagnosis of 21-trisomy syndrome. This condition results from the presence of an extra copy of chromosome 21, leading to developmental delays and physical abnormalities. The decision to induce labor was likely made to address the complications associated with this genetic anomaly.
