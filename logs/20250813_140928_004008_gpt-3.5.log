You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

Patient Case Analysis:

Analysis:
The patient's presentation of consciousness impairment, found unconscious on the floor with a burning coal stove nearby, and the subsequent diagnosis of acute carbon monoxide poisoning suggest that the patient may be experiencing impaired neurological function due to the toxic effects of carbon monoxide on the brain.

Given the patient's history of hypertension and current medication with amlodipine for blood pressure control, there is a possibility of underlying cardiovascular issues that may have predisposed the patient to the effects of carbon monoxide poisoning. This could indicate impairment in cardiovascular function.

The physical examination findings of pale lips, unresponsiveness to pain, and lack of cooperation further support the diagnosis of carbon monoxide poisoning affecting the central nervous system and potentially impairing sensory and motor functions.

Overall, the abnormal parts of the patient's case point towards impaired neurological and cardiovascular functions as a result of acute carbon monoxide poisoning.
