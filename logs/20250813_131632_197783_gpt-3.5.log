[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估ICU患者的严重疾病风险和死亡率？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和体征，可以看出患者表现出流行性出血热和脓毒血症脓毒性休克多器官功能衰竭等症状。辅助检查显示白细胞和血小板均显著偏高，肌酐和肌酸激酶水平升高，提示肾功能和肝功能受损。此外，血红蛋白水平高，但尿中检测到蛋白和隐血，提示肾功能异常。综合分析可疑患者可能存在急性肾功能衰竭、肝功能异常以及凝血功能异常等问题。
