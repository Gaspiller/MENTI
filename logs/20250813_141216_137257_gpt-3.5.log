基本信息:男，38岁，农民

[病案介绍]
主诉:
患者主因"发现患者服用安眠药"安定"约100片100分钟余"入院；
现病史:
患者本次入院缘于100分钟前服用安眠药（安定）量不详，发现时患者呼之能应，言语不清，无恶心、呕吐，无四肢抽搐，在当地未予处理，给予"120急救中心"联系，由我院急诊接诊入院，在我院急诊"洗胃、导泻"后，急诊科医师以"安眠药中毒"收住我科。患者自发病以来，意识不清，未大小便；
既往史:
患者家属诉患者既往体健，否认"高血压、糖尿病、心脏病、脑血管病"病史，否认"肝炎、结核"等急慢性传染病病史，预防接种史不详；
个人史:
生于原籍，久居当地，未到过疫区及牧区，无放射性物质及有毒物质接触史，否认性病史及接触史。
查体:
T：36.0℃，P：68次/分，R：13次/分，BP：135/89mmHg
T:36.0℃ ,P:68次/分,R:13次/分,BP:135/89/mmhg。患者昏迷状，刺痛有反应，能发音，不合作，平车推入病房。患者头颅无畸形，巩膜无黄染，双侧瞳孔直径大小约为2.0mm，对光反射均迟钝，口唇无紫绀，口角不偏，伸舌不合作，耳鼻外观未见明显异常，颈软，无抵抗，胸廓对称无畸形，双肺呼吸音粗，未闻及干湿性啰音，心前区无隆起，心律68次/分，律齐，心音可，各瓣膜听诊区均未闻及杂音，腹平软，腹部不合作，双下肢无水肿，四肢肌张力低，四肢肌力不合作，双侧Babinski征（-）；
辅助检查:
凝血五项(抗凝血):TT 21.60 Sec↑、FIB 1.56 g/L↓。生化(血清):HCYB 32.40 umol/L↑、LP(a) 483.10 mg/L↑、AST 14.40 U/L↓、Fe 37.80 umol/L↑、TP 62.40 g/L↓、GLO 19.50 g/L↓。患者双侧瞳孔直径大小约为2.0mm，对光反射均迟钝。
[output]  Based on the patient's case, the main abnormality is the ingestion of a large quantity of the sedative drug "diazepam" (Valium), leading to symptoms such as altered mental status, unclear speech, and unresponsiveness. The patient was found with dilated pupils that were slow to react to light, indicating possible central nervous system depression. Additionally, the patient's muscle tone and strength were reduced, and they exhibited uncooperative behavior.

The abnormal results in the laboratory tests, including prolonged thrombin time (TT) and decreased fibrinogen (FIB) levels, elevated homocysteine (HCYB) and lipoprotein (a) (LP(a)), decreased total protein (TP) and globulin (GLO) levels, and increased iron (Fe) levels, suggest possible liver dysfunction and metabolic disturbances due to the drug overdose.

In conclusion, the ingestion of a large quantity of diazepam has led to central nervous system depression, impaired muscle function, and possible liver dysfunction and metabolic abnormalities in this patient. Immediate medical intervention and supportive care are necessary to address these underlying issues.
