2. The task scenario provided involves a patient with abnormal findings in their kidney function, specifically indicating a potential diagnosis of IgA nephropathy.
3. From the tool list, the tool that best fits the user demand and task scenario is the "CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)".
4. This tool is specifically designed to estimate kidney function using creatinine-based equations, which aligns with the assessment needed for the patient in the scenario.
5. The CKD-EPI equation takes into account the patient's serum creatinine level, age, and gender to calculate the estimated GFR.
6. By choosing the "CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)" tool, we can provide the user with a suitable calculation method to assess the patient's kidney function accurately.

Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

Parameters:
- serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
- age (int): The age of the patient in years.
- gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

Returns:
- float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

Usage:
To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

Note:
- Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
- Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.

2025-08-13 13:31:31,214 - INFO - 1. Find the parameter "input_value" based on the Reference Text.
- The Reference Text mentions "serum_creatinine is missing a numerical value in mg/dL."
- From this, we can infer that the input_value for Creatinine is missing and needs to be in mg/dL.

2. Find the parameter "input_unit" based on the Function Docstring.
- The input_unit is defined as the index of the unit for the input_value in the units list.
- The units list includes 'mmol/L' (index 0), 'µmol/L' (index 1), 'mg/dL' (index 2), 'mg/100mL' (index 3), 'mg%' (index 4), 'mg/L' (index 5), and 'µg/mL' (index 6).
- Since the input_value is supposed to be in mg/dL, the input_unit should be 2.

3. Find the parameter "target_unit" based on the Function Docstring.
- The target_unit is defined as the index of the unit to which the value is to be converted to in the units list.
- We need to convert the input_value from mg/dL to another unit.
- We can randomly select a target_unit index from the units list (excluding index 2) for the conversion.
