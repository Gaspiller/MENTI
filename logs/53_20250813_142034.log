2025-08-13 14:20:54,039 - INFO - 1. 为了预测心脏事件的风险，特别是对于先天性心脏病患者，我们需要选择能够全面评估患者心脏事件风险的评分工具。给定的患者病例信息表明患者存在先天性心脏病，房间隔缺损，三尖瓣关闭不全等心脏问题，因此需要选择一个能够适用于这种特定情况的评分工具。

2. 在提供的工具列表中，适合用于预测心脏事件风险的工具包括HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events和Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)。然而，由于患者情况涉及心脏先天性问题，并非手术前的心脏风险评估，因此更适合选择HEART Score进行风险评估。

3. HEART Score针对急诊科（ED）患者胸痛的风险分层，可以评估患者的心脏事件风险并将其划分为低、中、高风险组。结合患者先天性心脏病，闭式缺损和三尖瓣问题，这个评分工具能够帮助确定患者可能面临的心脏事件风险水平。

4. 因此，最适合用于预测心脏事件风险的工具是HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events。

2025-08-13 14:21:00,122 - INFO - 1. history_score:
Since the Reference Text does not mention any specific historical information related to the patient's chest pain or cardiac events, we need to infer this score based on the general demographic information provided. The patient is a 37-year-old female, and she has a medical history of congenital heart disease with atrial septal defect and mild tricuspid regurgitation. Given these conditions, we can infer that the history_score for this patient would be "2" (Highly suspicious) based on the severity and complexity of the existing cardiac conditions.

2. ekg_score:
The Reference Text does not provide direct information on the patient's EKG findings. However, it mentions that the electrocardiogram (ECG) shows a sinus rhythm with incomplete right bundle branch block and T-wave abnormalities in leads II, III, aVF, V3, V4. Based on these findings, we can infer that the ekg_score for this patient would be "2" (Significant ST deviation), as T-wave abnormalities can indicate myocardial ischemia or damage.

3. age_score:
The patient's age is explicitly mentioned in the Reference Text as 37 years old. According to the age categories defined in the function docstring, the age_score for this patient would be "1" (between 45 and 64 years).

4. risk_factors_score:
Although the Reference Text does not provide explicit information about the number of traditional cardiovascular risk factors in the patient, we can consider the presence of congenital heart disease, mild tricuspid regurgitation, and cardiomegaly as significant cardiovascular risk factors. Therefore, we can infer that the risk_factors_score for this patient would be "2" (3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease).

5. troponin_score:
The Reference Text mentions that the patient's cardiac troponin levels are within the normal range (1-3 times normal limit), indicating no significant myocardial damage or injury. Therefore, the troponin_score for this patient would be "0" (≤ normal limit).

{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
