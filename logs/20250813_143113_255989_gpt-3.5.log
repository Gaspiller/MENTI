Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa): Calculate the Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa) in percentage.
    
    The FENa is a clinical tool used to evaluate oliguria and/or acute kidney injury of unclear etiology. It is most
    accurate in patients with oliguric acute kidney injury who have not been treated with diuretics, do not have
    chronic kidney disease, urinary tract obstruction, or acute glomerular disease.
    
    Parameters:
    serum_creatinine (float): Serum creatinine concentration (mg/dL)
    urine_sodium (float): Urine sodium concentration (mmol/L)
    serum_sodium (float): Serum sodium concentration (mmol/L)
    urine_creatinine (float): Urine creatinine concentration (mg/dL)
    
    Returns:
    float: The Fractional Excretion of Sodium (FENa) in percentage
    
    Note:
    FENa is calculated using the formula:
    FENa (%) = 100 × (serum_creatinine × urine_sodium) / (serum_sodium × urine_creatinine)

Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator: Calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

    This function uses a standard method recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),
    which considers the first trimester ultrasound measurements to be the most accurate method to establish gestational age.

    Parameters:
    - cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
                           If cycle_length is more than 28, the difference is added to the 40-week period.
    - last_menstrual_period (str): The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

    Returns:
    - str: The estimated due date in the format 'Day, Month DD, YYYY'.

    Usage:
    The function is intended for use by healthcare providers to estimate due dates for pregnant patients,
    which can help in managing pregnancy timelines effectively and in planning medical care accordingly.

    Example:
    'Monday, Oct 16, 2023'


CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk: Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in

    Parameters:
    hypertension (bool): True if the patient has hypertension, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has renal disease (dialysis, transplant, or Cr >2.26 mg/dL), False otherwise.

    This score is useful for patients undergoing preoperative evaluation but should not be used if a patient
    has already been diagnosed with OSA or uses CPAP at night. It helps in identifying patients who might have
    OSA and are at increased risk of perioperative cardiopulmonary complications, as well as other morbidity
    associated with OSA like daytime sleepiness and cardiopulmonary conditions.

Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis:  Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.
    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.
 

PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP: Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
    It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    sex (str): Patient's sex, either 'Female' or 'Male'.
    nursing_home_resident (bool): True if the patient is a nursing home resident, False otherwise.
