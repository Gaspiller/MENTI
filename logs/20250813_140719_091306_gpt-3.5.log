[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

根据提供的病例信息，患者表现出精神病性症状的躁狂发作，包括兴奋话多、乱语、精力旺盛、思维联想增快、兴趣爱好增多、关系妄想等。这种情况可能涉及脑部神经递质的不正常释放和调节，导致情绪和认知功能失调，可能影响到患者的情绪稳定性和社交功能。治疗方案中使用的药物主要是为了快速控制病情、稳定情绪并控制精神症状。综合分析可以推测患者可能存在神经系统功能的异常，特别是与情绪调节和认知功能相关的部分。
