2025-08-13 14:08:12,713 - INFO - 1. interest_pleasure:
Based on the provided text, there is no specific mention of the patient's interest or pleasure in doing things. However, considering the patient is experiencing symptoms like feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, it is likely that the interest or pleasure is affected. We can infer a moderate impact on interest/pleasure.
Filling Value: 2

2. feeling_down:
The patient's symptoms include feeling down, depressed, and hopeless, as mentioned in the text.
Filling Value: 3

3. sleep_issues:
There is no direct mention of sleep issues in the text. However, the patient describes symptoms of trouble concentrating, head dizziness, and feeling restless, which could potentially be related to sleep problems. We can infer a mild impact on sleep.
Filling Value: 1

4. tired_energy:
The patient does not specifically state feelings of tiredness or lack of energy. However, considering the overall presentation of symptoms, it is reasonable to assume some level of fatigue or lack of energy.
Filling Value: 2

5. appetite_issues:
The text does not provide information about appetite problems. Since the patient's main complaints are related to cardiovascular and neurological symptoms, we can assume a neutral impact on appetite.
Filling Value: 0

6. self_feeling:
The patient does not directly mention feelings of being bad about oneself or like a failure. Given the presence of other depressive symptoms, it is reasonable to infer some negative self-feelings.
Filling Value: 1

7. concentration:
The patient reports trouble concentrating as part of the symptoms. This indicates a direct impact on concentration.
Filling Value: 2

8. activity_level:
Although there is no specific mention of altered activity levels in the text, symptoms like restlessness, being fidgety, and feeling tired can indirectly suggest changes in activity levels. We can infer a moderate impact on activity level.
Filling Value: 2

9. suicidal_thoughts:
The patient denies suicidal thoughts in the text. Therefore, we can assume the absence of suicidal thoughts.
Filling Value: 0

2025-08-13 14:08:20,665 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.
The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
- "0" for 'Not at all'
- "1" for 'Several days'
- "2" for 'More than half the days'
- "3" for 'Nearly every day'
The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

Parameters:
- interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
- feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
- sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
- tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
- appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
- self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
- concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
- activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
- suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

Returns:
- int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.

Parameter List：
{
    "interest_pleasure": {"Value": 2, "Unit": "null"},
    "feeling_down": {"Value": 3, "Unit": "null"},
