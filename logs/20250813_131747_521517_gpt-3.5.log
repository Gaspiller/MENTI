You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}

   The patient is 33 years old.

2. Sex:
   The patient is female.

3. Surgery Type:
   There is no clear mention of the type of surgery in the reference text. Considering that the patient has been diagnosed with non-purulent thrombosis in the intracranial venous sinus and has undergone treatments like intravenous drip of sulbacin acid injection, muscle injection of mecobalamin injection, dehydration by intravenous injection of frusemide injection, and subcutaneous injection of low molecular weight sodium heparin injection, we can infer that the patient has undergone a major surgery. Therefore, the surgery_type parameter is 2.

4. Recent Event:
   There is no clear mention of recent surgeries or laparoscopic procedures over 45 minutes in the reference text. Since the patient has been diagnosed with thrombosis in the intracranial venous sinus, we can infer that there has been a recent major surgery involved in the treatment. Therefore, the recent_event parameter is 2.

5. Major Surgery:
   The patient has undergone major surgery as inferred in the Surgery Type analysis. Therefore, the major_surgery parameter is 1.

6. Congestive Heart Failure (CHF):
   There is no mention of congestive heart failure in the reference text. Therefore, the chf parameter is 0.

7. Sepsis:

8. Pneumonia:
   There is no mention of pneumonia in the reference text. Therefore, the pneumonia parameter is 0.

9. Plaster Cast:
   The patient has not been mentioned to have an immobilizing plaster cast. Therefore, the plaster_cast parameter is 0.

10. Fracture:
    There is no mention of hip, pelvis, or leg fracture in the reference text. Therefore, the fracture parameter is 0.

11. Stroke:
    The patient has a history of stroke. Therefore, the stroke parameter is 5.

12. Multiple Trauma:
    There is no mention of multiple traumas in the reference text. Therefore, the multiple_trauma parameter is 0.

13. Spinal Injury:
    There is no mention of an acute spinal cord injury causing paralysis in the reference text. Therefore, the spinal_injury parameter is 0.

14. Varicose Veins:
    There is no mention of varicose veins in the reference text. Therefore, the varicose_veins parameter is 0.

24. Heparin-Induced Thrombocytopenia:
    The patient does not have heparin-induced thrombocytopenia as mentioned in the reference text. Therefore, the heparin_thrombocytopenia parameter is 0.

25. Thrombophilia:
    The patient does not have other congenital or acquired thrombophilia as mentioned in the reference text. Therefore, the thrombophilia parameter is 0.

26. Mobility:
    Patient's mobility status has not been explicitly mentioned. Considering that the patient required treatment in a hospital setting and underwent various treatments, we can infer that the patient may be confined to bed for more than 72 hours. Therefore, the mobility parameter is 2.

27. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD):
    There is no mention of a history of inflammatory bowel disease in the reference text. Therefore, the ibd parameter is 0.

28. BMI Over 25:
    There is no clear mention of the patient's BMI in the reference text. Considering that the patient is female and may have undergone major surgery, there is a possibility that the BMI is over 25. Therefore, the bmi_over_25 parameter is 1.

29. Acute Myocardial Infarction (MI):
    There is no mention of acute myocardial infarction in the reference text. Therefore, the acute_mi parameter is 0.

30. Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD):
    There is no mention of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in the reference text. Therefore, the copd parameter is 0.

31. Malignancy:
    The patient has no presence or history of malignancy as mentioned in the reference text. Therefore, the malignancy parameter is 0.

32. Other Risk Factors:
    There are no specific other risk factors mentioned in the reference text. Therefore, the other_risk_factors parameter is 0.

33. Contraceptives Hormones:
    The patient has used oral contraceptives, which can be considered as a positive factor for hormones. Therefore, the contraceptives_hormones parameter is 1.

34. Reproductive History:
    There is no mention of a specific reproductive history in the reference text. Therefore, the reproductive_history parameter is 0.
