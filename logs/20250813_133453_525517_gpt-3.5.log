You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  1. Age:
   From the reference text, the patient is 60 years old.

2. Temperature:
   The rectal temperature of the patient is not directly mentioned in the reference text. We can assume a normal body temperature of 37.0°C based on the vital signs provided.

3. Mean Arterial Pressure:
   The mean arterial pressure of the patient is mentioned as 130/80 mmHg in the reference text. The Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) can be calculated as [(2 * Diastolic BP) + (Systolic BP)] / 3. Therefore, the MAP is ((2 * 80) + 130) / 3 = 96.7 mmHg. However, since the requirement is for the pressure to be in mm Hg, we will round this off to 97 mm Hg.

4. Heart Rate:
   The heart rate of the patient is mentioned as 106 beats per minute in the reference text.

5. Respiratory Rate:
   The respiratory rate of the patient is mentioned as 18 breaths per minute in the reference text.

6. Sodium:
   The serum sodium level of the patient is not explicitly mentioned in the reference text. We can infer a normal value of around 135-145 mmol/L for serum sodium based on typical ranges.

7. Potassium:
   The serum potassium level of the patient is not explicitly mentioned in the reference text. We can infer a normal value of around 3.5-5.0 mmol/L for serum potassium based on typical ranges.

8. Creatinine:
   The serum creatinine level of the patient is not explicitly mentioned in the reference text. We can infer a normal value of around 0.6-1.3 mg/100 mL for serum creatinine based on typical ranges.

9. Hematocrit:
   The hematocrit percentage of the patient is not provided in the reference text. Typically, hematocrit levels for men range from 40-54%. We can assume a value of 45% for this patient.

10. White Blood Cell Count:
    The white blood cell count of the patient is not directly mentioned in the reference text. Typically, the range for white blood cell count is around 4,500-11,000 cells/mm^3. We can assume a value of 7000 cells/mm^3 for this patient.

11. GCS (Glasgow Coma Scale):
    The Glasgow Coma Scale score of the patient is not provided in the reference text. Since the patient is coherent and able to provide medical history, we can infer a GCS score of 15.

12. pH:
    The arterial pH of the patient is not explicitly provided in the reference text. We can assume a normal arterial pH of around 7.35-7.45 based on typical ranges.

13. History of Severe Organ Insufficiency:
    The history status of the patient is not explicitly mentioned in the reference text. We will randomly assign a value of 0 for 'No'.

14. Acute Renal Failure:
    The presence of acute renal failure in the patient is not explicitly mentioned in the reference text. We will randomly assign a value of 0 for 'No'.

15. FiO2 (Fraction of Inspired Oxygen):
    The FiO2 of the patient is not directly provided in the reference text. We can assume a value of 0 for '<50%' based on the absence of specific information regarding oxygen supplementation.
