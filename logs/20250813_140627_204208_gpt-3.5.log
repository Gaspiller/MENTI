        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:

The score is used to track a patient's status during their stay in an intensive care unit to determine the extent of a person's organ function or rate of failure.

Parameters:

- creatinine (float): Serum creatinine in mg/dL.
- urine_output (float): Urine output in mL/day.
- o2_delivery_type (int): Index of the type of oxygen delivery method used. Types are as follows: 0 = nasal cannula, 1 = simple face mask, 2 = non-rebreather mask, 3 = high-flow nasal cannula.

Returns:
int: Total SOFA score which is the sum of individual scores across the specified parameters."

Corrected QT Interval (QTc): Calculate the Corrected QT Interval (QTc) for a patient.

    The QTc is used primarily to assess the risk of ventricular arrhythmias, especially torsades de pointes, 
    in patients with syncope or those receiving multiple QT-prolonging medications. A prolonged QT interval 
    can indicate a higher risk of cardiac arrhythmias. This function corrects the QT interval to a heart rate 
    of 60 beats per minute, accounting for variations due to different heart rates.

    Parameters:
        qt_interval (float): The measured QT interval in milliseconds.

    is unnecessary in patients considered low-risk.

    The PERC rule helps avoid unnecessary PE testing in low-risk patients. It requires that all criteria must be negative
    (i.e., all parameters must receive a 'no' to rule out PE without further testing).
