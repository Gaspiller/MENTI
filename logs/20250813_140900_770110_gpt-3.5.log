[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表被用于评估患者的神志状态和意识水平？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病史和辅助检查结果，可以初步推断患者可能存在电解质紊乱，包括低钠血症（Na 108.40 mmol/L↓↓）和低氯血症（Cl 54.50 mmol/L↓↓）。这种电解质紊乱可能导致神经系统功能受损，进而出现意识模糊、反应迟钝等症状。此外，患者的白蛋白水平降低（ALB 26.70 g/L↓），也可能与慢性疾病或营养不良有关。

综上所述，患者可能存在电解质紊乱和蛋白质代谢异常，导致神经系统功能异常，表现为意识障碍和神经反应迟钝。需要进一步详细的检查和治疗来确认诊断并帮助患者恢复健康。
