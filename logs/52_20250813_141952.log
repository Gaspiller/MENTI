2. 在给定的量表列表中，可以选择"HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"来评估患者在6周内发生重大心脏不良事件的风险。该量表基于患者的历史、心电图、年龄、风险因素和肌钙蛋白水平来计算HEART评分，帮助将急诊科患者分为低、中和高风险组。

3. 选择"HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"这个量表可以帮助医生对患者进行初步的风险分层，从而指导进一步的治疗管理和决策。

2025-08-13 14:20:18,084 - INFO - Step By Step Analysis:
1. history_score:
   - Patient has a history of intermittent chest tightness, palpitations, and shortness of breath for 12 years, with worsening symptoms over the last 1 day. The symptoms have been present for a long duration, indicating a moderately suspicious history score. Assign a value of 1.

2. ekg_score:
   - EKG findings indicate an ectopic rhythm, atrial fibrillation, ventricular premature beats, and ST-T changes. These findings suggest significant abnormalities, aligning with a score of 2.

3. age_score:
   - The patient is 80 years old, placing them in the "65 or older" category. Assign a value of 2.

4. risk_factors_score:
   - The patient has a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, stroke, chronic gastritis, and previous breast cancer. Although there is no mention of specific cardiovascular risk factors in the text, the patient's medical history suggests the presence of multiple risk factors. Assign a value of 2.

5. troponin_score:
   - The troponin levels are not explicitly mentioned in the text. Since the patient presents with acute exacerbation of symptoms indicative of cardiac involvement, consider their presentation and assign a troponin_score value of 1.

2025-08-13 14:20:30,362 - INFO - {{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories: History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Args:
history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
    0 = Slightly suspicious,
    1 = Moderately suspicious,
    2 = Highly suspicious.
ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
    0 = Normal,
    1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
    2 = Significant ST deviation.
age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
    0 = less than 45,
    1 = between 45 and 64,
    2 = 65 or older.
risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
    0 = No known risk factors,
    1 = 1–2 risk factors,
    2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
    0 = ≤ normal limit,
    1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
    2 = >3 times normal limit.

Returns:
int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
0-3 points indicate low risk,
4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
7-10 points indicate high risk.

Example:
>>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
