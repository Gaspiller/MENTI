[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于评估患者的平均动脉压？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据患者的病历信息和辅助检查结果，可以推测患者患有急性脑梗死导致的右侧肢体活动不利。此外，患者的双侧瞳孔等大等圆，伸舌右偏，言语謇涩，以及右侧肢体运动功能不全，提示可能存在与脑梗死相关的神经系统损伤。血压控制不佳也可能加重了脑血管病变的风险。整体来看，患者可能存在语言障碍、肢体运动障碍和认知功能减退等问题。
