You are a parameter extraction model. You will receive a Reference Text and a Function Docstring. Your task is to determine the parameters from the Reference Text based on the parameter filling rules described in the Function Docstring, including the values and units of the parameters.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The Value and Unit of parameters you output need to be strictly in accordance with the Reference Text. You are prohibited from performing unit conversions.
2. If there is a discrepancy in the unit of the parameter between the Reference Text and the Function Docstring, please use the unit from the Reference Text as the standard. Do not convert the units on your own.
3. If the parameter does not have a unit, output 'null' in the Unit.
4. All parameters in the Function Docstring must be included in the parameter list. If the parameter values are missing, fill them randomly. The Value must not be 'null'.
5. For parameters that do not have a clear ratxing in the Reference Text, please infer and fill them out based on the actual circumstances described in the reference text and the scoring standards provided in the Function Docstring.
6. You need to first produce a step-by-step analysis, considering each parameter individually.
7. The Parameters List you output is a JSON file, and this JSON file should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
{The parameters list here.}
```

Here are some examples:
Function Docstring: 
{{"Calculate the Body Mass Index (BMI) for an individual.

Args:
weight (float): The weight of the individual in kilograms.
height (float): The height of the individual in centimeters.

Returns:
float: the BMI (kg/m^2).

Description:
The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a simple index of weight-for-height commonly used to classify
underweight, overweight, and obesity in adults. It is calculated by dividing the weight in
kilograms by the square of the height in meters. Although widely used, BMI has limitations,
particularly for very muscular individuals and in different ethnic groups with varying body
statures, where it may not accurately reflect body fat percentages."}}

    Calculate the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.

    The CURB-65 calculator can be used in the emergency department setting to risk stratify a patient’s community acquired pneumonia.
    It includes points for confusion, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age.
    
    Parameters:
    confusion (int): Confusion status, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes.
    bun (int): Blood urea nitrogen status, where 0 = BUN ≤ 19 mg/dL (≤ 7 mmol/L urea) and 1 = BUN > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L urea).
    respiratory_rate (int): Respiratory rate status, where 0 = < 30 breaths/min and 1 = ≥ 30 breaths/min.
    blood_pressure (int): Blood pressure status, where 0 = Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg, and 1 = Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg.
    age (int): Age status, where 0 = < 65 years and 1 = ≥ 65 years.

    Returns:
    int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

    Usage:
    This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.
    
    Example:
    >>> curb_65_score(1, 1, 1, 0, 1)

Step By Step Analysis:

[output]  The parameters needed for the CURB-65 Score calculation are as follows:
1. Confusion
2. BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)
3. Respiratory Rate
4. Blood Pressure
5. Age

Let's analyze each parameter based on the given Reference Text:

1. Confusion:
- There is no clear indication of the patient's confusion status in the Reference Text. We can assume that the patient is not confused unless stated otherwise. Hence, we can set the value of confusion to 0.

2. BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen):
- The Reference Text provides the patient's BUN value as 15 mg/dl.
- According to the Function Docstring, if the BUN value is less than or equal to 19 mg/dl, it's considered as 0. Otherwise, it's considered as 1.
- The patient's BUN value of 15 mg/dl falls under the category BUN ≤ 19 mg/dl.
- Therefore, we can set the value of BUN to 0.

3. Respiratory Rate:
- The Reference Text does not provide a specific respiratory rate value. However, it mentions that the patient has a good sleep, normal breathing pattern, and no shortness of breath.
- Since there is no indication of respiratory distress, we can assume the respiratory rate to be less than 30 breaths/min. Hence, we set the value of respiratory_rate to 0.

4. Blood Pressure:
- The Reference Text provides the patient's blood pressure as Systolic BP 108 mmHg and Diastolic BP 85 mmHg.
- Both systolic and diastolic blood pressures fall under the category of Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg in the Function Docstring.
- Therefore, we can set the value of blood_pressure to 0.

5. Age:
- The Reference Text states that the patient is a 56-year-old female.
- Since the patient's age is greater than or equal to 65 years, we can set the value of age to 1.

Based on the analysis, the Parameters List would be:
```json
{
    "confusion": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null},
    "bun": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null},
    "respiratory_rate": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null},
    "blood_pressure": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null},
    "age": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}
}
```
