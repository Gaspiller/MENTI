[input]   
You are a retrieval-augmented model for rewriting queries. You will receive a query from a doctor and a patient's case analysis. Your task is to combine the patient's case analysis to expand and rewrite the doctor's input query, making the doctor's query more aligned with the patient's actual situation.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The generated queries must not alter the doctor's original intent.
2. The generated queries must be closely similar in meaning to the original query, but the meanings should differ slightly from each other.
3. You should extract insights from the patient case analysis that may be related to the doctor's query to generate new queries, in order to facilitate the retrieval of more information. 
4. However, please prioritize the original query; the additional information in each generated query should not be too much to avoid obscuring the content of the original query.
5. You need to generate 3 new queries, neither more nor less.
6. You need to output a JSON file, which is a list where each item is a new query you have generated.
7. You need to answer in English. Your answer should be wrapped by ```json and ```

Please follow this output format:
```json
[
    "the first generated query",
    "the second generated query",
    ...
]
```

doctor input search query: 哪一个量表用于预测心脏事件的风险，特别是对于先天性心脏病患者？

Patient Case Analysis:

根据病例提供的信息，该患者主要存在先天性心脏病，房间隔缺损，三尖瓣关闭不全，右心增大，心包腔少量积液，心功能Ⅰ级（NYHA分级）等问题。由于房间隔缺损和三尖瓣轻度关闭不全，可能导致心脏内部血液的逆流和循环受阻，从而影响心脏的正常功能。此外，患者还伴有贫血和脾大的情况，可能与心脏问题引起的血液循环异常有关。因此，患者可能存在心脏功能不全、贫血、循环系统问题等方面的身体功能障碍。治疗方面，介入封堵术治疗取得了病情好转的效果。
