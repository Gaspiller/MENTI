2025-08-17 15:06:59,551 - INFO - 1. The User Demand asks for a scale used to assess the severity of anxiety symptoms in adults, which aligns with the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) tool from the Tool List.
2. The Task Scenario describes symptoms of excitement, loquacity, exaggerated speech, increased energy, poor sleep, delusions of reference, and feeling monitored, which are characteristic of a manic episode with psychotic features. The mention of improvement in symptoms with treatment suggests possible emotional instability, elevated mood, and impulsivity, indicating potential abnormalities in the neural circuits related to emotion regulation and cognition.
3. While the scenario hints at mood instability and manic symptoms, the core focus remains on assessing anxiety severity, and the GAD-7 is more apt for evaluating anxiety rather than manic symptoms.
4. Therefore, choosing the GAD-7 tool is in line with the core medical intent of assessing anxiety severity in adults, as per the User Demand.

2025-08-17 15:07:07,333 - INFO - {{Function Docstring:
Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
to assess and monitor treatment responses.

Parameters:
- nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
- control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
- worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
- trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
- restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
- irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
- fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

Returns:
int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

Usage Example:
gad_7_score = calculate_gad_7(3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score
