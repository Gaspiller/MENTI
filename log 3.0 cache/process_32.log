2025-08-17 15:06:02,147 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool to assess the 10-year risk of a coronary artery atherosclerosis heart attack. This scenario involves evaluating the cardiovascular risk profile of a patient with multiple risk factors for coronary heart disease, such as severe hypertension, heart damage, atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and a history of smoking.

2. Among the tools provided in the Tool List, the most suitable tool for assessing the 10-year risk of coronary artery atherosclerosis heart attack in this patient would be the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease".

3. The Framingham Risk Score is specifically designed to estimate the risk of developing hard coronary heart disease in patients aged 30-79 without a history of coronary heart disease, diabetes, or intermittent claudication. This tool considers key risk factors such as age, sex, smoking status, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and medication use, which align well with the cardiovascular risk factors present in the described patient case.

4. Given the patient's background of severe hypertension, heart damage, atherosclerosis, dyslipidemia, diabetes mellitus, and smoking, applying the Framingham Risk Score will provide a comprehensive assessment of their 10-year risk for coronary artery atherosclerosis heart attacks.

{{Calculate the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease in patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease history, diabetes, or intermittent claudication.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
    - sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
    - total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    Returns:
    float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.
