2025-08-17 14:54:55,308 - INFO - 1. The User Demand involves assessing the risk of Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) after a patient experiences an acute cerebral infarction. This scenario suggests a need to evaluate the risk of thrombotic events in the context of a recent stroke.

2. Among the tools provided in the Tool List, the most suitable one for assessing VTE risk in this context is the "Caprini Score for Venous Thromboembolism (2005)". This tool calculates the risk of VTE in patients based on various clinical and historical risk factors, which align well with the needs of assessing VTE risk post-acute cerebral infarction.

3. The Caprini Score takes into account factors such as age, medical history, and immobilization, which are relevant considerations after a patient experiences a stroke and may be at an increased risk of developing VTE.

4. Considering the scenario of a patient with acute cerebral infarction and a persistent patent foramen ovale (PFO), the Caprini Score can help determine the VTE risk profile and guide prophylactic interventions to prevent potential complications.
