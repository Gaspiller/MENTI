2025-08-17 15:12:10,266 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool that predicts the risk of major cardiac events within 6 weeks for patients. This aligns with the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events as it helps risk-stratify patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome.

2. The Task Scenario provides information about the patient's main medical issue being third-degree atrioventricular block, which affects the heart's conduction system, leading to irregular heartbeats and symptoms like palpitations, fatigue, and fainting. The patient has received a dual-chamber pacemaker implantation for treatment, and the condition has stabilized, with good blood pressure control and no other significant organ function abnormalities. This scenario confirms the relevance of using a tool related to cardiac events and risk assessment like the HEART Score.

Therefore, based on the User Demand and Task Scenario analysis, the most suitable tool from the list is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-17 15:12:17,734 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

Parameter List：
{{{"history_score": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null},
  "ekg_score": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null},
  "age_score": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null},
  "risk_factors_score": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null},
  "troponin_score": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
1. Analyzing 'history_score'
Function Docstring:
history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
    0 = Slightly suspicious,
    1 = Moderately suspicious,
    2 = Highly suspicious.

Parameter List:
Value: 0
Unit: null

Analysis: The units are consistent as the history_score is an integer value without any units specified in the Function Docstring. Therefore, the units comply with the requirements. 

2. Analyzing 'ekg_score'
Function Docstring:
ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
    0 = Normal,
    1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
    2 = Significant ST deviation.

Parameter List:
Value: 1
Unit: null

Analysis: The units are consistent as the ekg_score is an integer value without any units specified in the Function Docstring. Therefore, the units comply with the requirements. 

3. Analyzing 'age_score'
Function Docstring:
age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
    0 = less than 45,
    1 = between 45 and 64,
    2 = 65 or older.

Parameter List:
Value: 1
Unit: null

Analysis: The units are consistent as the age_score is an integer value without any units specified in the Function Docstring. Therefore, the units comply with the requirements. 

4. Analyzing 'risk_factors_score'
Function Docstring:
risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
    0 = No known risk factors,
    1 = 1–2 risk factors,
    2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.

Parameter List:
Value: 1
Unit: null

Analysis: The units are consistent as the risk_factors_score is an integer value without any units specified in the Function Docstring. Therefore, the units comply with the requirements. 

5. Analyzing 'troponin_score'
Function Docstring:
troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
    0 = ≤ normal limit,
    1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
    2 = >3 times normal limit.

Parameter List:
Value: 0
Unit: null

Analysis: The units are consistent as the troponin_score is an integer value without any units specified in the Function Docstring. Therefore, the units comply with the requirements. 

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters are integer values without specific units."
