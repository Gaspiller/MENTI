2025-08-17 15:22:52,962 - INFO - 1. The core medical intent in the User Demand is to identify a tool for evaluating a patient's cardiac risk before undergoing amniocentesis for terminating a pregnancy with a high-risk trisomy 18 fetus.

2. The key components in the provided case scenario are related to the pregnancy termination due to high-risk trisomy 18 and the necessity of undergoing amniocentesis procedure. Additionally, it mentions the need for assessing cardiac risk before the procedure.

3. Among the tools in the Tool List, the most suitable one for evaluating the patient's cardiac risk pre-operatively in the context of pregnancy termination and amniocentesis is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk." This tool is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, making it relevant for pre-operative risk assessment in this case.

2025-08-17 15:23:01,423 - INFO - {{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
