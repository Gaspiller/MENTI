2025-08-17 15:17:43,473 - INFO - 1. The User Demand asks for a tool used to assess the severity of a patient's depression.
2. The Task Scenario mentions that the patient has been diagnosed with moderate to severe depression, with symptoms including low mood, agitation, unexplained crying, headache, decreased appetite, insomnia, decreased concentration, among others.
3. The scenario also describes the impact of depression on the patient's physiological functions, focusing on sleep regulation, emotional regulation, concentration, and appetite control.
4. The treatment plan involves antidepressant medication and psychiatric care to improve the patient's emotional state, sleep quality, attention levels, and appetite.
5. Given the focus on assessing the severity of depression symptoms and monitoring treatment effects, the tool that aligns most closely with assessing depression severity is the "PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)."
6. The PHQ-9 is specifically designed as a clinical scale to diagnose and monitor the severity of depression symptoms based on the DSM criteria for major depressive disorder.

2025-08-17 15:17:54,020 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.
