2025-08-17 15:24:49,842 - INFO - 1. The User Demand mentions the need for a tool to assess the postoperative risk in patients undergoing cardiac surgery. Among the tools provided, the most suitable choice would be the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" as it specifically focuses on assessing the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

2. In the provided Task Scenario, the patient's preoperative condition and history indicate a potential risk for cardiac complications, especially considering the presence of 21 trisomy syndrome which can have implications on cardiac health. Additionally, the mention of not using insulin preoperatively hints at a possible undiagnosed or untreated diabetic condition, further emphasizing the need for cardiac risk assessment.

3. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index tool aligns well with the scenario as it evaluates specific risk factors related to cardiac health such as ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, history of cerebrovascular disease, and other factors that can impact the postoperative cardiac outcomes.

Therefore, based on the User Demand for assessing postoperative cardiac risk in patients and the details provided in the Task Scenario, the most appropriate tool to choose from the list is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk".

{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
