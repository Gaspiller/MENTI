2025-08-17 15:15:54,097 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool related to the evaluation of a patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).
2. Among the tools provided in the Tool List, the tool directly related to calculating Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" tool.
3. The information for the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" tool states that it is used to calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure from systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which is a critical health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, and hypertensive emergencies.
4. Given the Task Scenario mentions the patient's coronary artery disease and heart failure, which both involve cardiovascular issues, the evaluation of Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) would be crucial in assessing the patient's perfusion and organ function.
5. Therefore, based on the User Demand for assessing a patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and the cardiovascular issues outlined in the Task Scenario, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" tool.

    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333"}}
