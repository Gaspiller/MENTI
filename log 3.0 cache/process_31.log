2025-08-17 15:05:34,498 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically mentions "评估患者10年内冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病发作风险," which translates to "assessing the risk of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease events in the next 10 years." This aligns closely with the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease from the tool list.

2. The Task Scenario provides additional details about the patient's case, highlighting the presence of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, which further supports the selection of the Framingham Risk Score tool.

3. Considering the core medical intent of evaluating the risk of coronary artery disease events over a 10-year period, the Framingham Risk Score is the most suitable tool from the list to address this specific demand.

{{Calculate the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease in patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease history, diabetes, or intermittent claudication.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
    - sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
    - total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    Returns:
    float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.

Parameter List:
{{{"age": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "years"}, 
"sex": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, 
"smoker_status": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, 
"total_cholesterol": {"Value": 162.4, "Unit": "mg/dL"},

Step By Step Analysis:

1. Check if the "age" parameter complies with the function docstring requirements:
   - Function Docstring: age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
   - Parameter List - "age": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "years"}
   There are no unit discrepancies for the "age" parameter. It is in years and within the valid range. 

2. Check if the "sex" parameter complies with the function docstring requirements:
   - Function Docstring: sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
   - Parameter List - "sex": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}
   There are no unit discrepancies for the "sex" parameter. It is specified as 1 for male.

3. Check if the "smoker_status" parameter complies with the function docstring requirements:
   - Function Docstring: smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
   - Parameter List - "smoker_status": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}
   There are no unit discrepancies for the "smoker_status" parameter. It is specified as 1 for smoker.

4. Check if the "total_cholesterol" parameter complies with the function docstring requirements:
   - Function Docstring: total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
   - Parameter List - "total_cholesterol": {"Value": 162.4, "Unit": "mg/dL"}
   There are no unit discrepancies for the "total_cholesterol" parameter. It is in mg/dL.

5. Check if the "hdl_cholesterol" parameter complies with the function docstring requirements:
   - Function Docstring: hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
   - Parameter List - "hdl_cholesterol": {"Value": 7.73, "Unit": "mg/dL"}
   There are no unit discrepancies for the "hdl_cholesterol" parameter. It is in mg/dL.

6. Check if the "systolic_bp" parameter complies with the function docstring requirements:
   - Function Docstring: systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
   - Parameter List - "systolic_bp": {"Value": 130, "Unit": "mm Hg"}
   There are no unit discrepancies for the "systolic_bp" parameter. It is in mm Hg.

7. Check if the "bp_medication" parameter complies with the function docstring requirements:
   - Function Docstring: bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.
   - Parameter List - "bp_medication": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}
   There are no unit discrepancies for the "bp_medication" parameter. It is specified as 0 for no medication.
