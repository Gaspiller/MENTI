2025-08-17 15:26:56,550 - INFO - 1. The User Demand asks for a tool used to calculate the actual sodium level in patients with hyperglycemia, indicating a need for a correction factor.
   
2. Given that the Task Scenario involves a 64-year-old retired male with a history of type 2 diabetes and hyperglycemia, we see a direct connection to hyperglycemia and the need for sodium correction in this patient population.

3. Considering the history of type 2 diabetes, the current blood glucose levels provided, and the concern for potential complications and progression of the disease, the tool that aligns most closely with the User Demand and Task Scenario is "Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia."
   
4. The "Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia" tool specifically addresses the calculation of the corrected sodium level in patients with hyperglycemia, which is directly relevant to the scenario described.

2025-08-17 15:27:01,078 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Corrected Sodium for Hyperglycemia using Hillier's method from 1999.

    This function computes the corrected sodium level in patients with hyperglycemia,
    accounting for osmotic shifts of water from the intracellular to the extracellular space,
    which can lead to dilutional hyponatremia. The formula uses a correction factor of 2.4 mEq/L
    for every 100 mg/dL increase in serum glucose above the normal threshold of 100 mg/dL.

    Parameters:
        measured_sodium (float): The measured sodium level in mEq/L.
        serum_glucose (float): The serum glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
        float: The corrected sodium level in mEq/L.

    Example:
        >>> sodium_correction_hyperglycemia(140, 200)
        142.4}}
    
Parameter List:
{{{"measured_sodium": {"Value": 140.0, "Unit": "mEq/L"}, "serum_glucose": {"Value": 190.97, "Unit": "mg/dL"}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:

1. Parameter "measured_sodium":
    - Function Docstring specifies the unit requirement as mEq/L.
    - Parameter List provides "Value" as 140.0 and "Unit" as mEq/L.
    - The units are consistent, no conversion needed.

2. Parameter "serum_glucose":
    - Function Docstring specifies the unit requirement as mg/dL.
    - Parameter List provides "Value" as 190.97 and "Unit" as mg/dL.
    - The units are consistent, no conversion needed.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use the same units as required."
}
