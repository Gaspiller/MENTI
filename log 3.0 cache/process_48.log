2025-08-17 15:11:48,783 - INFO - 1. The user demand is asking for a tool used to predict the risk of major cardiac events in patients over the next 6 weeks.
2. The key keywords in the demand are "predict," "patients," "6 weeks," and "major cardiac events."
3. Among the tools provided, the most suitable tool based on the user demand is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."
4. The HEART Score helps risk-stratify patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk categories for acute coronary syndrome.
5. Given the patient's history of mitral valve disease, atrial fibrillation, and pulmonary hypertension, the HEART Score can assist in assessing the patient's cardiac risk.
6. The HEART Score matches the core intent of predicting major cardiac events and is aligned with the keywords in the user demand.
7. Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-17 15:11:55,141 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
