2025-08-17 15:15:02,598 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333}}

Parameter List：
{{{
    "systolic_bp": {"Value": 110, "Unit": "mmHg"},
    "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 92, "Unit": "mmHg"}
}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
{{The systolic_bp parameter in the Function Docstring requires the unit of mmHg, which matches the provided unit in the Parameter List. The diastolic_bp parameter in the Function Docstring also requires the unit of mmHg, which is consistent with the provided unit in the Parameter List. Therefore, all parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use consistent units.}}

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use indices to specify units."
}
