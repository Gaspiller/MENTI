2025-08-17 15:09:46,574 - INFO - 1. The User Demand mentions "量表用于对上消化道出血患者进行分层评估" which translates to "Which scale is used for stratified assessment of patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding to determine suitability for outpatient treatment?"
   
2. From the tool list provided, the tool that aligns best with the User Demand is the "Rockall Score for Upper Gastrointestinal Bleeding."

3. The Rockall Score is a clinical scoring system used to assess the risk of rebleeding or mortality in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding. It helps stratify patients into low, intermediate, and high-risk categories, aiding in the decision-making process for outpatient versus inpatient management.

4. Given the scenario of a patient diagnosed with gastric cancer and experiencing bleeding leading to iron-deficiency anemia, along with the characteristics of a large irregular mass in the stomach seen on endoscopy, the Rockall Score would be appropriate for assessing the severity and risk associated with upper gastrointestinal bleeding in this context.
