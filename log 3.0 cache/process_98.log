2025-08-17 15:29:49,654 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to evaluate the severity of pneumonia in patients, making it clear that we need a calculator related to pneumonia severity assessment.
  
2. Reviewing the Tool List, two tools stand out as relevant for assessing pneumonia severity:
   - CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity
   - PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP

3. Considering the keywords "evaluating pneumonia severity" and the need to assess a patient's pneumonia severity, we should choose a tool that directly aligns with this core medical intent.

4. The CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity is explicitly designed to risk stratify a patient's community-acquired pneumonia based on key parameters like confusion, respiratory rate, age, etc. This tool is ideal for evaluating pneumonia severity, guiding decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.

5. Given the patient case involves pneumonia infection and the need to assess the severity of the condition, the most suitable tool from the list is the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.

Therefore, the chosen tool is the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.

{{Calculate the CURB-65 Score for Pneumonia Severity.

The CURB-65 calculator can be used in the emergency department setting to risk stratify a patient’s community acquired pneumonia.
It includes points for confusion, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), respiratory rate, blood pressure, and age.

Parameters:
confusion (int): Confusion status, where 0 = No and 1 = Yes.
bun (int): Blood urea nitrogen status, where 0 = BUN ≤ 19 mg/dL (≤ 7 mmol/L urea) and 1 = BUN > 19 mg/dL (> 7 mmol/L urea).
respiratory_rate (int): Respiratory rate status, where 0 = < 30 breaths/min and 1 = ≥ 30 breaths/min.
blood_pressure (int): Blood pressure status, where 0 = Systolic BP ≥ 90 mmHg and Diastolic BP > 60 mmHg, and 1 = Systolic BP < 90 mmHg or Diastolic BP ≤ 60 mmHg.
age (int): Age status, where 0 = < 65 years and 1 = ≥ 65 years.

Returns:
int: The CURB-65 score which ranges from 0 to 5, indicating the severity of pneumonia.

Usage:
This function can be used in emergency settings to quickly assess the severity of pneumonia in patients and to guide decisions regarding hospitalization and treatment initiation.

Example:
>>> curb_65_score(1, 1, 1, 0, 1)
4
