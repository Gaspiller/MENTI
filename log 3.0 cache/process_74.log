2025-08-17 15:20:39,099 - INFO - Based on the User Demand which asks for a tool to assess the severity of pneumonia in a patient, and the Task Scenario which highlights lung infection foci and pleural effusion in the patient case, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the "PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP".

1. The PSI/PORT Score is specifically designed to calculate the severity of pneumonia in patients with Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP). This aligns perfectly with the user's demand for assessing pneumonia severity.

2. The parameters of the PSI/PORT Score include factors such as respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, temperature, pulse rate, and presence of pleural effusion, which directly relate to the patient's lung infection foci and pleural effusion as described in the case scenario.

3. By using the PSI/PORT Score tool, healthcare providers can accurately risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia, which is crucial in guiding treatment decisions and interventions for the patient's respiratory condition.

Therefore, the most suitable tool based on the User Demand and Task Scenario is the "PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP".

{{Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

Parameters:
age (int): Patient's age in years.
sex (str): Patient's sex, either 'Female' or 'Male'.
nursing_home_resident (bool): True if the patient is a nursing home resident, False otherwise.
neoplastic_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of neoplastic disease, False otherwise.
liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of liver disease, False otherwise.
chf_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, False otherwise.
cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of cerebrovascular disease, False otherwise.
renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of renal disease, False otherwise.
altered_mental_status (bool): True if the patient has altered mental status, False otherwise.
respiratory_rate (bool): True if respiratory rate is ≥30 breaths/min, False otherwise.
systolic_bp (bool): True if systolic blood pressure is <90 mmHg, False otherwise.
temperature (bool): True if temperature is <35°C or >39.9°C, False otherwise.
pulse (bool): True if pulse rate is ≥125 beats/min, False otherwise.
blood_ph (bool): True if blood pH is <7.35, False otherwise.
bun (bool): True if BUN is ≥30 mg/dL or ≥11 mmol/L, False otherwise.
sodium (bool): True if sodium level is <130 mmol/L, False otherwise.
glucose (bool): True if glucose level is ≥250 mg/dL or ≥14 mmol/L, False otherwise.
hematocrit (bool): True if hematocrit is <30%, False otherwise.
oxygen_pressure (bool): True if partial pressure of oxygen is <60 mmHg or <8 kPa, False otherwise.
pleural_effusion (bool): True if there is pleural effusion on x-ray, False otherwise.

Returns:
int: The total PSI/PORT Score indicating the severity of the pneumonia.}}
