2025-08-17 15:25:34,468 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool to assess the risk of postoperative cardiac complications in non-cardiac surgery patients. This aligns with the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" from the Tool List, as it is designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

2. The Task Scenario mentions the patient's right inguinal hernia repair, which is a non-cardiac surgical procedure. Additionally, it highlights the presence of congenital right ventricular developmental abnormalities and incomplete right bundle branch block, indicating potential cardiac issues that need close monitoring and appropriate cardiac function assessment. This further supports the need for a tool to assess the risk of postoperative cardiac complications.

3. Considering the core keywords like "non-cardiac surgery," "postoperative cardiac complications," and the patient's specific clinical conditions, the most suitable tool from the Tool List to address these concerns is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-17 15:25:41,476 - INFO - {{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.

Step By Step Analysis:
Parameter: elevated_risk_surgery
Param Docstring: elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
Param List: Value=true, Unit=null
Comparison: No unit conversion required as the parameter is boolean. Parameter value is consistent with the docstring requirement.

Parameter: history_of_ischemic_heart_disease
Param Docstring: history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
Param List: Value=false, Unit=null
Comparison: No unit conversion required as the parameter is boolean. Parameter value is consistent with the docstring requirement.

Parameter: history_of_congestive_heart_failure
Param Docstring: history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
Param List: Value=false, Unit=null
Comparison: No unit conversion required as the parameter is boolean. Parameter value is consistent with the docstring requirement.

Parameter: history_of_cerebrovascular_disease
Param Docstring: history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
Param List: Value=false, Unit=null
Comparison: No unit conversion required as the parameter is boolean. Parameter value is consistent with the docstring requirement.

Parameter: preop_treatment_with_insulin
Param Docstring: preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
Param List: Value=false, Unit=null
Comparison: No unit conversion required as the parameter is boolean. Parameter value is consistent with the docstring requirement.

Parameter: preop_creatinine_above_threshold
Param Docstring: preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.
Param List: Value=false, Unit=null
Comparison: No unit conversion required as the parameter is boolean. Parameter value is consistent with the docstring requirement.
