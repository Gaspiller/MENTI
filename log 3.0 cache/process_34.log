2025-08-17 15:06:41,779 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool that can assess the risk of the patient developing coronary heart disease within the next 10 years.
2. The Task Scenario provides detailed information about the patient's medical history, indicating the presence of coronary artery disease, triple vessel disease, old myocardial infarction, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia (high cholesterol and low HDL).
3. Considering the keywords "risk of coronary artery disease," "patient's medical history," "high cholesterol," "cardiovascular disease," and "10-year risk," the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease."

Parameters:
- age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
- sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
- smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
- total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
- hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
- systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
- bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

Returns:
float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
which may not fully align with current population risks."}}
