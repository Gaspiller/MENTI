2. From the Tool List, the tool that aligns most closely with predicting the risk of major cardiac adverse events within a specified time frame is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."
3. The HEART Score is specifically designed for risk-stratifying emergency department patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS), which includes major cardiac events.
4. The provided patient case indicates cardiac abnormalities such as left ventricular hypertrophy, reduced ventricular function, and valve regurgitation, making the HEART Score a suitable choice for assessing the risk of major cardiac events.
5. By calculating the HEART Score based on the patient's history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels, we can predict the risk of major cardiac events within the specified time frame of 6 weeks as requested in the User Demand.

2025-08-17 15:11:37,280 - INFO - {{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on the number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)

The history_score parameter is an integer value representing the patient's history assessment score which can be 0, 1, or 2. The provided value of 1 is valid and complies with the Function Docstring. No unit conversion is necessary.

{{"ekg_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null}}}
The ekg_score parameter is an integer value representing the EKG findings score which can be 0, 1, or 2. The provided value of 2 is valid and complies with the Function Docstring. No unit conversion is necessary.

{{"age_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null}}}
The age_score parameter is an integer value representing the patient's age score which can be 0, 1, or 2. The provided value of 2 is valid and complies with the Function Docstring. No unit conversion is necessary.

{{"risk_factors_score": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}}}
The risk_factors_score parameter is an integer value representing the number of cardiovascular risk factors score which can be 0, 1, or 2. The provided value of 0 is valid and complies with the Function Docstring. No unit conversion is necessary.

{{"troponin_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null}}}
The troponin_score parameter is an integer value representing the initial troponin levels score which can be 0, 1, or 2. The provided value of 2 is valid and complies with the Function Docstring. No unit conversion is necessary.
