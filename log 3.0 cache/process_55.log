2025-08-17 15:14:23,118 - INFO - Based on the User Demand and the provided scenario which describes a patient with a primary diagnosis of coronary artery atherosclerotic heart disease and associated risk factors such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cerebral arterial stenosis, presenting with chest pain and imaging findings suggestive of cerebral artery narrowing, a suitable tool to predict the risk of major cardiac adverse events within 6 weeks would be the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

The HEART Score is specifically designed to risk-stratify patients presenting with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome. The components of the HEART Score include patient history, EKG findings, age, cardiovascular risk factors, and troponin levels, aligning closely with the presented case of suspected coronary artery disease with associated risk factors.

The tool's ability to categorize patients into low, moderate, and high-risk groups aligns well with the need to assess the patient's risk of major cardiac adverse events. The scenario emphasizes the presence of potential cardiovascular and cerebral vascular issues, making the HEART Score a suitable choice for predicting cardiac events in this context.

Therefore, the most suitable tool from the list is the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events.

2025-08-17 15:14:27,915 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
