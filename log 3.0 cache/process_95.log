2025-08-17 15:28:34,479 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to assess severity and predict mortality in ICU patients.
2. The Task Scenario provides clinical information about a patient with abnormal findings and impaired bodily functions, indicating a need for severity assessment.
3. Given the keywords "ICU patient's severity and mortality prediction" in the User Demand and the ICU-related clinical scenario, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "APACHE II Score" tool.
4. The APACHE II Score is designed precisely for assessing severity and predicting mortality in ICU patients, aligning perfectly with the User Demand and the Task Scenario.
5. Therefore, the chosen tool is the "APACHE II Score."
