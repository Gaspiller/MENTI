2025-08-17 15:10:58,413 - INFO - 1. The User Demand asks for a tool that assesses the risk of myocardial infarction or cardiac arrest in a patient post-surgery.
2. Among the tools provided, the tool that specifically addresses cardiac risk in patients undergoing surgery is the "Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)" tool.
3. The Task Scenario describes a patient undergoing surgery for thyroid abnormalities related to Hashimoto's thyroiditis, with a focus on the surgical intervention for structural changes in the thyroid gland. While the scenario highlights the thyroid condition, there is no explicit mention of cardiovascular issues.
4. Given the focus on surgery and the potential implications for cardiovascular risk postoperatively, the most suitable tool from the list is the "Gupta Perioperative Risk for Myocardial Infarction or Cardiac Arrest (MICA)".
5. This tool is directly aligned with the core keywords in the User Demand related to assessing cardiac risk in a postoperative setting, making it the appropriate choice for the scenario presented.
