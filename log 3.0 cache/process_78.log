2. Among the tools provided, the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" aligns most closely with the User Demand. This tool is specifically designed for assessing the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent non-cardiac surgery.
3. Considering the Task Scenario provided, which describes a pregnant patient with possible complications related to uterine contractions and cervical dilation, there is a need to assess the patient's cardiac risk before any potential interventions or procedures.
4. Based on the alignment with the core medical intent and the relevance to the Task Scenario, the most suitable tool to choose is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-17 15:21:56,183 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.

Parameter List: false
Function Docstring expects bool type.

3. Parameter: history_of_congestive_heart_failure
Function Docstring: history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.

Parameter List: false
Function Docstring expects bool type.

4. Parameter: history_of_cerebrovascular_disease
Function Docstring: history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.

Parameter List: false
Function Docstring expects bool type.

5. Parameter: preop_treatment_with_insulin
Function Docstring: preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.

Parameter List: false
Function Docstring expects bool type.

6. Parameter: preop_creatinine_above_threshold
Function Docstring: preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

Parameter List: false
Function Docstring expects bool type.
