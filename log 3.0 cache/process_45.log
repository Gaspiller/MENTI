2025-08-17 15:10:36,669 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to assess the bleeding risk and the likelihood of outpatient treatment for patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
2. The Task Scenario provided details about a patient presenting with hematemesis (vomiting blood) and signs of severe anemia and hypovolemic shock, suggesting acute upper gastrointestinal bleeding.
3. The condition of the patient, with a history of liver cancer but not liver disease and normal BUN levels, eliminates tools related to liver disease or renal function assessment.
4. Based on the keywords "upper gastrointestinal bleeding," "bleeding risk," and "outpatient treatment," the most suitable tool from the list is the "Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS)."
5. The Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score is specifically designed to assess bleeding severity in patients with upper gastrointestinal bleeding and helps determine the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the condition.
6. Considering the core medical intent and keywords alignment, the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score is the most relevant tool for assessing the bleeding risk and potential outpatient management for the patient described in the Task Scenario.

2025-08-17 15:10:44,262 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) for adult patients being considered for hospital admission due to upper GI bleeding.
    
Parameters:
- hemoglobin (float): Patient's hemoglobin level in g/dL.
- bun (float): Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) level in mg/dL.
- systolic_bp (int): Initial systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
- sex (int): Patient's sex, 0 for female, 1 for male.
- heart_rate (int): Indicates if heart rate is ≥100 per minute, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
- melena (int): Indicates if melena is present, 0 for no, 1 for yes.
- syncope (int): Indicates if there has been a recent syncope, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
- hepatic_disease (int): Indicates history of hepatic disease, 0 for no, 2 for yes.
- cardiac_failure (int): Indicates if cardiac failure is present, 0 for no, 2 for yes.

Returns:
- int: Glasgow-Blatchford Score, ranging from 0 to 23.

This scoring system aids in determining the necessity for hospital admission based on the severity of the patient's condition.
Lower scores indicate lower risk, while higher scores suggest higher risk and potential need for acute intervention.

Parameter List：
{{{"hemoglobin": {"Value": 5.7, "Unit": "g/dL"}, 
  "bun": {"Value": 15.41, "Unit": "mg/dL"}, 
  "systolic_bp": {"Value": 83, "Unit": "mm Hg"}, 
  "sex": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}, 
  "heart_rate": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, 
  "melena": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, 
  "syncope": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}, 
  "hepatic_disease": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}, 
  "cardiac_failure": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
1. Parameter "hemoglobin":
   Function Docstring specifies that hemoglobin should be in "g/dL" unit. The parameter list denotes "hemoglobin" value in "g/dL", hence no unit conversion is needed.
   
2. Parameter "bun":
   Function Docstring specifies that BUN should be in "mg/dL" unit. The parameter list denotes "bun" value in "mg/dL", hence no unit conversion is needed.
   
3. Parameter "systolic_bp":
   Function Docstring specifies that Systolic blood pressure should be in "mm Hg" unit. The parameter list denotes "systolic_bp" value in "mm Hg", hence no unit conversion is needed.
   
4. Parameter "sex":
   Function Docstring does not provide any specific unit for "sex". The parameter list denotes "sex" value as 0 or 1, where 0 represents female and 1 represents male. No unit conversion is needed.
   
5. Parameter "heart_rate":
   Function Docstring does not provide any specific unit for "heart_rate". The parameter list denotes "heart_rate" value as 0 or 1, where 0 represents heart rate < 100 per minute and 1 represents heart rate ≥100 per minute. No unit conversion is needed.
   
6. Parameter "melena":
   Function Docstring does not provide any specific unit for "melena". The parameter list denotes "melena" value as 0 or 1, where 0 represents absence of melena and 1 represents presence of melena. No unit conversion is needed.
   
7. Parameter "syncope":
   Function Docstring does not provide any specific unit for "syncope". The parameter list denotes "syncope" value as 0 or 2, where 0 represents no recent syncope and 2 represents recent syncope. No unit conversion is needed.
   
8. Parameter "hepatic_disease":
   Function Docstring does not provide any specific unit for "hepatic_disease". The parameter list denotes "hepatic_disease" value as 0 or 2, where 0 represents no history of hepatic disease and 2 represents history of hepatic disease. No unit conversion is needed.
   
9. Parameter "cardiac_failure":
   Function Docstring does not provide any specific unit for "cardiac_failure". The parameter list denotes "cardiac_failure" value as 0 or 2, where 0 represents no cardiac failure and 2 represents presence of cardiac failure. No unit conversion is needed.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use specific values to represent conditions."
