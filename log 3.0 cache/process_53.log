2025-08-17 15:13:34,559 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifies a need for a tool that predicts the risk of major cardiac events in cardiac patients within the next 6 weeks.
2. The Task Scenario provides clinical details of a 72-year-old male patient presenting with symptoms of acute myocardial infarction, including ECG changes, elevated cardiac biomarkers, and coronary artery findings. The patient also has comorbidities such as hypertension and diabetes.
3. Considering the keywords "major cardiac events" and the specific scenario of acute myocardial infarction in a cardiac patient, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events." This tool helps to risk-stratify patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome, aligning closely with the User Demand and Task Scenario.
4. The HEART Score takes into account parameters such as patient history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels, which are all relevant in assessing the risk of major cardiac events in the given patient.
5. By choosing the HEART Score tool, we can provide an accurate risk assessment for the patient's future major cardiac events, aiding in their timely and appropriate management.

Function Docstring:
{{"Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
