2025-08-17 15:14:00,953 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool that assesses the risk of major cardiac events in the next 6 weeks for patients. This aligns with the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events" tool from the Tool List.
   
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient diagnosed with acute non-ST elevation myocardial infarction with third-degree atrioventricular block, indicating significant cardiac impairment, arrhythmias, and conduction system abnormalities. The patient also has a history of type 2 diabetes and a long smoking history. The elevated levels of troponin I, abnormal cardiac enzyme profile, and ECG findings support the diagnosis and further confirm the presence of myocardial infarction and conduction system issues.

3. Given the patient's clinical presentation, including the significant cardiac dysfunction, history of diabetes, and smoking, the most appropriate tool for risk assessment in this case would be the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events." This tool considers factors such as age, ECG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels, which are crucial in evaluating the patient's risk for major cardiac events in the next 6 weeks.

2025-08-17 15:14:10,208 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
