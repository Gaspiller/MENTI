2025-08-17 15:13:12,573 - INFO - 1. The user demand focuses on predicting the risk of cardiac events, particularly for patients with congenital heart disease. This indicates the need for a tool that specifically assesses the cardiac risk in individuals with underlying heart conditions.

2. Considering the Task Scenario provided, which details the specific case of a patient with congenital heart disease, enlarged right heart, anemia, and splenomegaly, further emphasizes the relevance of a tool that can evaluate the risk of cardiac events in such patients. The presence of ventricular septal defect (VSD) and tricuspid regurgitation in the congenital heart disease patient underscores the importance of accurate risk assessment for potential adverse cardiac outcomes.

3. In this context, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events." This tool is designed to calculate the risk score for major cardiac events in patients presenting with symptoms such as chest pain, which can be critical in guiding further management, including risk stratification and decision-making in emergency departments.

Therefore, based on the User Demand for predicting cardiac event risk in congenital heart disease patients and the Task Scenario describing a patient with congenital heart defects, the most appropriate tool to choose is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-17 15:13:19,285 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
