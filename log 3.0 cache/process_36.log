2025-08-17 15:07:19,731 - INFO - Based on the user demand, which is asking for a tool to assess the severity of generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, the most suitable tool from the provided list is the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) tool.

1. The user demand explicitly mentions assessing the severity of generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, aligning perfectly with the purpose of the GAD-7 tool, which is specifically designed for screening and monitoring anxiety disorders.

Therefore, the most appropriate tool for this scenario is the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7).

2025-08-17 15:07:24,630 - INFO - {{"Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score 
based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their 
frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days,
2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders 
including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.
It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings 
to assess and monitor treatment responses.

Parameters:
- nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
- control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
- worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
- trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
- restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
- irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
- fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

Returns:
int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

Usage Example:
gad_7_score = calculate_gad_7(3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score

Parameter List：{{{"nervous": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, "control_worrying": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}, "worry_too_much": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, "trouble_relaxing": {"Value": 3, "Unit": null}, "restlessness": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, "irritability": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}, "fear_of_awful_events": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}}}}
The nervous parameter is correctly provided as an integer as required by the Function Docstring.
The control_worrying parameter is correctly provided as an integer as required by the Function Docstring.
The worry_too_much parameter is correctly provided as an integer as required by the Function Docstring.
The trouble_relaxing parameter is correctly provided as an integer as required by the Function Docstring.
The restlessness parameter is correctly provided as an integer as required by the Function Docstring.
The irritability parameter is correctly provided as an integer as required by the Function Docstring.
The fear_of_awful_events parameter is correctly provided as an integer as required by the Function Docstring.
Since all parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements, the final decision is "calculate".

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters are integers and match the scoring criteria."
