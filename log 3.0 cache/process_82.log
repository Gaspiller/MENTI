2025-08-17 15:23:14,947 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess a patient's cardiac risk preoperatively for uterine fibroid removal surgery.
2. The Task Scenario provides information about the patient's history of arrhythmia (pacemaker), mild valve regurgitation, and the need for anesthesia consideration.
3. Among the provided tools in the Tool List, the most suitable tool for assessing cardiac risk preoperatively in this scenario is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
4. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, which aligns well with the user's demand for a cardiac risk assessment preoperatively.
5. The presence of a history of cardiac issues like arrhythmias and valve regurgitation in the Task Scenario further supports the selection of the Revised Cardiac Risk Index tool.
6. Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List based on the User Demand and Task Scenario analysis is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-17 15:23:21,637 - INFO - {{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

Parameters:
elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 Âµmol/L.

Returns:
int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

Usage:
The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
