2025-08-17 15:25:55,687 - INFO - Based on the provided User Demand, the tool needed to evaluate the risk of cardiac complications after non-cardiac surgery is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" from the Tool List.

Here is the detailed analysis:
1. The User Demand specifies the need for a tool to assess the risk of cardiac complications following non-cardiac surgery. The "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" is explicitly designed for this purpose, as it calculates the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery.
2. The Task Scenario highlights the patient's history of coronary heart disease (CHD) with Class II heart failure, indicating pre-existing cardiac issues that could potentially impact the patient's risk during surgery. Therefore, assessing the cardiac risk before the non-cardiac surgery aligns with the patient's clinical background.
3. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index considers specific risk factors related to cardiac health, such as history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, and other cardiac-related parameters, making it the most relevant tool for evaluating the patient's risk of cardiac complications post-surgery.

Therefore, based on the User Demand and the clinical scenario presented, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk".

2025-08-17 15:26:04,207 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
