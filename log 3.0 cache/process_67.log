2025-08-17 15:18:06,184 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to assess the severity of depression in a patient. This aligns with the description of the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) tool in the tool list.
2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with a history of symptoms related to depression, including low mood, rumination, self-blame, sleep disturbances, and psychomotor agitation. It also mentions behavioral abnormalities, denial of illness, and possible brain changes related to depression. These symptoms and clinical findings are in line with the assessment criteria of the PHQ-9 tool.
3. The PHQ-9 is designed to assess and monitor the severity of depressive symptoms based on specific criteria related to depression, which directly matches the scenario provided.
4. Given the strong alignment between the User Demand, Task Scenario, and the description of the PHQ-9 tool, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List is "PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9)."

2025-08-17 15:18:17,324 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.
