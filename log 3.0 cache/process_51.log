2025-08-17 15:12:55,626 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to predict the risk of major cardiac events in patients within 6 weeks. The keywords in the demand are "量表" (scale) and "预测" (predict), indicating the need for a risk prediction tool.

2. The Task Scenario provides information about the patient's medical history, including chronic heart failure, dilated cardiomyopathy, atrial fibrillation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and other conditions. This aligns with the need for a tool that can assess the patient's risk of major cardiac events.

3. Considering the keywords in the User Demand and the patient's medical history in the Task Scenario, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events." This tool is specifically designed to assess the risk of acute coronary syndrome in patients presenting with chest pain, aligning well with the demand for predicting major cardiac events.

Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-17 15:12:59,093 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

Args:
history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
0 = Slightly suspicious,
1 = Moderately suspicious,
2 = Highly suspicious.
ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
0 = Normal,
1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
2 = Significant ST deviation.
age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
0 = less than 45,
1 = between 45 and 64,
2 = 65 or older.
risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
0 = No known risk factors,
1 = 1–2 risk factors,
2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
0 = ≤ normal limit,
1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
2 = >3 times normal limit.

Returns:
int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
0-3 points indicate low risk,
4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
7-10 points indicate high risk.

Example:
>>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
7
