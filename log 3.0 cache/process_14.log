2025-08-17 14:58:58,686 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to evaluate a patient's glomerular filtration rate (肾小球滤过率). This aligns with the CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR) tool from the provided list.

2. In the Task Scenario, the patient's medical history indicates a range of conditions, including urinary tract infection, right kidney stone, acute renal failure, type 2 diabetes, and severe anemia. Laboratory results show elevated creatinine levels and low hemoglobin levels, confirming the diagnosis of acute renal failure and severe anemia. Given the emphasis on renal issues, the need for assessing kidney function through the glomerular filtration rate calculation is crucial, making the CKD-EPI Equations for GFR tool highly relevant.

Based on the User Demand and the patient's medical history focusing on renal conditions, the most suitable tool from the list is the CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).

{{Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.
