2025-08-17 15:26:17,861 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in a patient undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
2. The Task Scenario mentions that the patient has a history of congenital heart disease and has undergone repair surgery, indicating potential abnormalities in cardiac function.
3. Based on the demand and scenario, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk." This tool is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery based on specific risk factors, including cardiac history.
4. The tool aligns perfectly with the keywords "assessing risk of major cardiac complications in non-cardiac surgery patients."
5. Therefore, I choose the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" as the most appropriate tool.

2025-08-17 15:26:25,722 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.

Step By Step Analysis:
- Parameter "elevated_risk_surgery":
  Function Docstring: The parameter "elevated_risk_surgery" should be a boolean value indicating whether the surgery is of elevated risk types. The unit requirement is correctly met.
- Parameter "history_of_ischemic_heart_disease":
  Function Docstring: The parameter "history_of_ischemic_heart_disease" should be a boolean value indicating the history of specific heart conditions. The unit requirement is correctly met.
- Parameter "history_of_congestive_heart_failure":
  Function Docstring: The parameter "history_of_congestive_heart_failure" should be a boolean value indicating the history of specific heart conditions. The unit requirement is correctly met.
- Parameter "history_of_cerebrovascular_disease":
  Function Docstring: The parameter "history_of_cerebrovascular_disease" should be a boolean value indicating the history of specific conditions related to the brain. The unit requirement is correctly met.
- Parameter "preop_treatment_with_insulin":
  Function Docstring: The parameter "preop_treatment_with_insulin" should be a boolean value indicating whether the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively. The unit requirement is correctly met.
- Parameter "preop_creatinine_above_threshold":
  Function Docstring: The parameter "preop_creatinine_above_threshold" should be a boolean value indicating if pre-operative creatinine levels are above a certain threshold. The unit requirement is correctly met.
