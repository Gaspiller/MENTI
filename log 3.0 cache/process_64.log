2025-08-17 15:17:09,316 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to evaluate a patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP). This indicates a need for a tool that calculates the MAP based on specific parameters such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure.

2. Analyzing the Tool List provided:
   - The tool "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" is directly related to the evaluation of MAP based on systolic and diastolic blood pressure readings.
   
3. Analyzing the Task Scenario:
   - The scenario describes a patient with symptoms suggestive of common bile duct stones with acute suppurative cholangitis, sepsis, and localized peritonitis. The patient's condition is complicated by jaundice, fever, altered mental status, elevated inflammatory markers, and imaging findings of common bile duct stones.
   - The focus of the scenario is on the patient's clinical presentation, complications related to infection, implications for bile duct function, and the necessity for vigilant monitoring and appropriate treatment modifications.

Based on the User Demand for evaluating Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) and the clinical context provided in the Task Scenario indicating an acute medical condition requiring close monitoring and management adjustments, the most suitable tool from the list is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator.

2025-08-17 15:17:12,115 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333

Parameter Listï¼š
{{{"systolic_bp": {"Value": 85, "Unit": "mmHg"}, "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 63, "Unit": "mmHg"}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
1. systolic_bp:
Function Docstring Info:
- Required Unit: mmHg
Parameter List Info:
- Provided Unit: mmHg
--> The units match, no unit conversion required for systolic_bp.

2. diastolic_bp:
Function Docstring Info:
- Required Unit: mmHg
Parameter List Info:
- Provided Unit: mmHg
--> The units match, no unit conversion required for diastolic_bp.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use the same unit of mmHg."
}
