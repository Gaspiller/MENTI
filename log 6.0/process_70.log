2025-08-20 14:07:50,121 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to calculate a patient's estimated due date during pregnancy. This aligns with the tool "Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator" from the Tool List, as it is explicitly designed to calculate the estimated due date based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.
2. The Task Scenario mentions a case of a patient diagnosed with diabetes complicating pregnancy, fungal vaginitis, and oligohydramnios. While the scenario focuses on the challenges related to diabetes control, fetal health, and fungal infection, the core keyword "pregnancy" is central to the patient's condition.
3. Given that the demand is specifically related to a patient's expected due date during pregnancy, the most suitable tool to choose is the "Pregnancy Due Dates Calculator" from the Tool List.

2025-08-20 14:07:54,009 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

This function uses a standard method recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),
which considers the first-trimester ultrasound measurements to be the most accurate method to establish gestational age.

Parameters:
- cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
                       If cycle_length is more than 28, the difference is added to the 40-week period.
- last_menstrual_period (str): The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

Returns:
- str: The estimated due date in the format 'Day, Month DD, YYYY'.

Usage:
The function is intended for use by healthcare providers to estimate due dates for pregnant patients,
which can help manage pregnancy timelines effectively and plan medical care accordingly.

Example:
'Monday, Oct 16, 2023'
Parameter List:
{
    "cycle_length": {"Value": 28, "Unit": "days"},
    "last_menstrual_period": {"Value": "2018/03/15", "Unit": null}
}
Step By Step Analysis:
{
    Chosen Decision: calculate
    Supplementary Information: All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters are already in the required format.
}
Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters are already in the required format."
