2025-08-20 13:53:47,972 - INFO - Based on the User Demand for assessing the severity of generalized anxiety disorder symptoms, the most suitable tool from the provided Tool List is the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7).

1. The User Demand specifies the need for a tool to evaluate the severity of generalized anxiety disorder symptoms.
2. Among the tools provided, the GAD-7 is explicitly designed for assessing the severity of anxiety symptoms, making it a direct match to the keywords in the user's demand.
3. The GAD-7 assesses seven items related to anxiety symptoms over the past two weeks, providing a total score that indicates the severity of the disorder.
4. Since the task scenario involves a patient diagnosed with cardiac autonomic neuropathy, which can present symptoms including palpitations and shortness of breath, the focus on assessing anxiety fits well with the potential psychological impact of this condition on the patient's well-being.
5. The GAD-7 would be relevant in this case to evaluate the patient's anxiety symptoms, especially considering the impact of the diagnosed condition on their overall health and quality of life.

Therefore, the most suitable tool to choose based on the User Demand and the Task Scenario is the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7).

2025-08-20 13:53:53,348 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the GAD-7 (General Anxiety Disorder-7) score. This function computes the total score based on seven items that assess the severity of various signs of anxiety according to their frequency over the past two weeks. Each item is scored from 0 to 3 (0 = Not at all, 1 = Several days, 2 = More than half the days, 3 = Nearly every day).

This scale is a quick screening tool for detecting the presence of clinically significant anxiety disorders including Generalized Anxiety Disorder, Panic Disorder, Social Phobia, and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. It is highly sensitive and specific across various cutoffs, used extensively in primary care and mental health settings to assess and monitor treatment responses.

Parameters:
- nervous (int): Score for feeling nervous, anxious, or on edge.
- control_worrying (int): Score for not being able to stop or control worrying.
- worry_too_much (int): Score for worrying too much about different things.
- trouble_relaxing (int): Score for having trouble relaxing.
- restlessness (int): Score for being so restless that it is hard to sit still.
- irritability (int): Score for becoming easily annoyed or irritable.
- fear_of_awful_events (int): Score for feeling afraid as if something awful might happen.

Returns:
int: The total GAD-7 score, ranging from 0 to 21.

Usage Example:
gad_7_score = calculate_gad_7(3, 2, 1, 3, 0, 2, 1)
print(f"GAD-7 Score: {gad_7_score}") # Outputs the calculated GAD-7 score
