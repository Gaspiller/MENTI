Step-By-Step Analysis:
1. User Demand: The demand specifically asks for a tool used to assess a patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This aligns perfectly with the CKD-EPI Equations for GFR, which is designed to estimate kidney function using creatinine-based equations.
   
2. Task Scenario: The scenario describes a patient with symptoms suggestive of kidney function insufficiency, including edema, fatigue, facial swelling, and shortness of breath. The patient has elevated creatinine, uric acid, and blood glucose levels along with abnormal urine results, indicating renal dysfunction. This reinforces the need for further kidney function assessment and treatment to manage fluid retention and metabolic waste accumulation.
   
3. Conclusion: Given the focus on assessing kidney function in a patient with suspected chronic kidney disease, the most suitable tool from the list is the CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR). This tool will provide a non-invasive estimate of the patient's GFR, aiding in monitoring kidney function and guiding appropriate interventions.

2025-08-20 13:47:12,482 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.
