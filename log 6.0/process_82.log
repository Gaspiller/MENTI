2025-08-20 14:13:59,674 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifies the need for an assessment tool used to evaluate a patient's cardiac risk before uterine fibroid surgery.
2. The Task Scenario highlights the patient's diagnosis of uterine fibroids and irregular endometrial hyperplasia, as well as the presence of a pacemaker post-implantation, indicating potential underlying cardiac issues that require close monitoring.
3. Given the focus on assessing cardiac risk in a patient undergoing uterine fibroid surgery with a pacemaker, the most relevant tool from the Tool List is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
4. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, making it an ideal choice for evaluating the cardiac risk in the context of uterine fibroid surgery with a pacemaker.
5. The tool considers specific risk factors related to cardiac history, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and other factors to provide a comprehensive assessment of cardiac risk in the preoperative setting.
6. By selecting the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, we align closely with the core keywords in the User Demand and address the cardiac risk evaluation requirements outlined in the Task Scenario.

2025-08-20 14:14:05,061 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.

{{{"elevated_risk_surgery": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, "history_of_ischemic_heart_disease": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, "history_of_congestive_heart_failure": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, "history_of_cerebrovascular_disease": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, "preop_treatment_with_insulin": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, "preop_creatinine_above_threshold": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}}}}
