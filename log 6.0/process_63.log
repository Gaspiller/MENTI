2025-08-20 14:05:10,987 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool to evaluate a patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP).
2. The provided Task Scenario mentions a case of chronic heart failure with reduced ejection fraction, complete left bundle branch block, and signs of right atrial pressure elevation. These conditions are related to impaired cardiac function, electrical conduction abnormalities, and hemodynamic issues.
3. Among the tools in the Tool List, the most relevant tool for assessing a patient's MAP in the context of heart failure, electrical conduction abnormalities, and hemodynamic compromise is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator.
4. The MAP is a key parameter used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow, which is crucial in medical scenarios such as heart failure, where maintaining adequate organ perfusion is essential.
5. Therefore, based on the alignment with the keywords in the User Demand and the clinical context described in the Task Scenario, the most suitable tool to choose is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator.

2025-08-20 14:05:15,364 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).

MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.

Parameters:
systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.

Returns:
float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.

Example:
>>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
93.33333333333333

Parameter Listï¼š
{
"systolic_bp": {"Value": 145, "Unit": "mmHg"},
"diastolic_bp": {"Value": 65, "Unit": "mmHg"}
}
Step By Step Analysis:
1. systolic_bp:
Function Docstring Unit: mmHg
Parameter List Unit: mmHg
- The unit of systolic_bp in the Parameter List matches the requirement in the Function Docstring.

2. diastolic_bp:
Function Docstring Unit: mmHg
Parameter List Unit: mmHg
- The unit of diastolic_bp in the Parameter List matches the requirement in the Function Docstring.

Final Answer:

{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use consistent units."
