2. The Task Scenario mentions a patient with a marginal placenta previa and bleeding issues, indicating the need for close monitoring and potential complications during the delivery process.
3. Given the focus on cardiac risk assessment before surgery, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
4. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery.
5. This tool aligns perfectly with the core medical intent in the User Demand, which is to evaluate cardiac risk before a high-risk surgical procedure.
6. Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List based on the User Demand and Task Scenario is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-20 14:14:32,996 - INFO - {{"Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
