2025-08-20 14:15:05,631 - INFO - Based on the User Demand and the Task Scenario, where the focus is on evaluating the pre-operative risk for a patient undergoing surgery, the most suitable tool from the provided list is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to assess the postoperative risk for cardiac surgery. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is designed for this precise purpose, as it assesses the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

2. The Task Scenario, despite mentioning a genetic abnormality in the fetus, also highlights the decision for inducing labor, indicating a potential surgical intervention. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is relevant in cases of elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery, aligning with the context of the scenario.

3. The absence of significant symptoms related to the genetic disorder in the patient, along with normal creatinine levels and the lack of insulin treatment, further support the decision to focus on pre-operative risk assessment, making the Revised Cardiac Risk Index the appropriate choice.

Therefore, the most suitable tool to evaluate the pre-operative risk for a patient undergoing surgery, as per the User Demand and Task Scenario, is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-20 14:15:17,309 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{"Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.

The provided value in the Parameter List is 'false', which is consistent with the function requirements. 
No unit conversion is needed for a boolean value. Parameter 'history_of_ischemic_heart_disease' complies with the function docstring requirements.

3. Parameter 'history_of_congestive_heart_failure':
Function Docstring states that this parameter should be a boolean (True or False) to indicate if there are specific signs related to congestive heart failure.
The provided value in the Parameter List is 'false', which is consistent with the function requirements. 
No unit conversion is needed for a boolean value. Parameter 'history_of_congestive_heart_failure' complies with the function docstring requirements.

4. Parameter 'history_of_cerebrovascular_disease':
Function Docstring states that this parameter should be a boolean (True or False) to indicate if there is a history of cerebrovascular disease.
The provided value in the Parameter List is 'false', which is consistent with the function requirements. 
No unit conversion is needed for a boolean value. Parameter 'history_of_cerebrovascular_disease' complies with the function docstring requirements.

5. Parameter 'preop_treatment_with_insulin':
Function Docstring states that this parameter should be a boolean (True or False) to indicate if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
The provided value in the Parameter List is 'false', which is consistent with the function requirements. 
No unit conversion is needed for a boolean value. Parameter 'preop_treatment_with_insulin' complies with the function docstring requirements.

6. Parameter 'preop_creatinine_above_threshold':
Function Docstring states that this parameter should be a boolean (True or False) to indicate if pre-operative creatinine levels are above a certain threshold.
