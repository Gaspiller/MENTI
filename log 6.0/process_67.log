2025-08-20 14:06:47,640 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifies evaluating the severity of depression in a patient, which requires a tool to assess the level of depressive symptoms.
2. The Task Scenario indicates that the patient likely has severe depression based on their clinical presentation and history.
3. The symptoms described in the scenario align with those assessed by the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) tool, which is designed to diagnose and quantify the severity of depression symptoms.
4. The PHQ-9 assesses various criteria related to depression, such as feelings of sadness, sleep disturbances, fatigue, changes in appetite, self-criticism, concentration issues, activity levels, and suicidal thoughts.
5. Given that the scenario describes a patient with depressive symptoms and possible cognitive impairment, the PHQ-9 would be the most suitable tool for evaluating the severity of depression in this case.

2025-08-20 14:06:54,723 - INFO - {{"Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.
