2025-08-20 14:06:26,598 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to assess the severity of depression in patients.
2. The symptoms provided in the Task Scenario include feeling down, irritability, crying, headache, loss of interest, social avoidance, decreased appetite, and sleep problems, indicating a clinical diagnosis of moderate to severe depression.
3. The specific symptoms mentioned, such as feeling down, loss of interest, social avoidance, and appetite issues, align with the core criteria assessed by the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9).
4. The PHQ-9 is designed to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms based on specific criteria related to mood, sleep, energy levels, appetite, self-esteem, concentration, activity levels, and suicidal thoughts.
5. Given that the Task Scenario describes a clinical case of depression with specific symptoms matching the criteria evaluated by the PHQ-9, the most suitable tool to assess the severity of depression in this case is the PHQ-9 calculator.

{{Calculate the PHQ-9 (Patient Health Questionnaire-9) score.

    The PHQ-9 is a clinical scale used to diagnose depression and to quantify and monitor the severity of depression symptoms.
    It evaluates symptoms based on the 9 DSM criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD). Each criterion is scored from 0 to 3:
    - "0" for 'Not at all'
    - "1" for 'Several days'
    - "2" for 'More than half the days'
    - "3" for 'Nearly every day'
    The function sums these scores to provide an overall severity score ranging from 0 to 27.

    Parameters:
    - interest_pleasure (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of little interest or pleasure in doing things.
    - feeling_down (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of feeling down, depressed, or hopeless.
    - sleep_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble with falling or staying asleep, or sleeping too much.
    - tired_energy (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feeling tired or having little energy.
    - appetite_issues (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating issues with poor appetite or overeating.
    - self_feeling (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating feelings of being bad about oneself, or feeling like a failure.
    - concentration (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating trouble concentrating on things.
    - activity_level (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating altered activity levels, either moving too slowly or being too fidgety.
    - suicidal_thoughts (int): Index from 0 to 3 indicating frequency of thoughts of self-harm or being better off dead.

    Returns:
    - int: The total PHQ-9 score, which is the sum of all the individual scores for the symptoms listed above.
