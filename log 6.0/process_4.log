2025-08-20 13:40:47,133 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool to assess the likelihood of streptococcal infection in pediatric patients with pharyngitis, which is a condition commonly associated with sore throat and inflammation of the throat.
2. The Task Scenario describes a case of bronchopneumonia in a pediatric patient, with symptoms including cough, fever, and wheezing. The case mentions a CT scan showing inflammatory lesions in the right upper lobe of the lung, as well as neutropenia and mild regurgitation in the mitral and tricuspid valves.
3. Given the focus on assessing the likelihood of streptococcal infection in a pediatric patient with pharyngitis, the most suitable tool from the provided list is the "Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis".
4. This tool is specifically designed to evaluate the probability of Group A Streptococcus infection in patients presenting with symptoms of pharyngitis, aligning well with the User Demand for assessing the etiology of pharyngitis in children.
5. Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List that best matches the core keywords in the User Demand is the "Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis".

{{ Calculate the Centor Score (Modified/McIsaac) for Strep Pharyngitis.
    
    This scoring system helps clinicians determine the likelihood of Group A Streptococcus (GAS) 
    in patients with symptoms of pharyngitis, which is critical for deciding whether to proceed 
    with testing for strep pharyngitis. The score integrates factors such as age, tonsillar exudate, 
    cervical lymphadenopathy, temperature, and the presence of cough to stratify the risk.
    
    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient in years.
    - exudate_swelling (bool): True if there is exudate or swelling on the tonsils, False otherwise.
    - tender_swollen_lymph_nodes (bool): True if there are tender/swollen anterior cervical lymph nodes, False otherwise.
    - temperature (float): Patient's temperature in degrees Celsius.
    - cough (bool): True if cough is present, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    - int: The calculated Centor Score, which ranges from -1 to 4.
    
    Usage:
    Typically used in primary care settings to assess the necessity for further testing for GAS infection,
    guiding the judicious use of antibiotics in managing pharyngitis. Higher scores suggest a higher probability
    of streptococcal infection and may warrant testing and/or treatment.
