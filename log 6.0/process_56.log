2025-08-20 14:02:42,617 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool to evaluate a patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP). This aligns perfectly with the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" tool from the Tool List.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with conditions such as pulmonary heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, type II respiratory failure, and hypertension, all of which can impact cardiovascular and respiratory function. The evaluation of Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) is crucial in such cases to assess tissue perfusion, blood flow, and overall cardiovascular health.

3. The formula used to calculate MAP is based on systolic and diastolic blood pressure, which are essential parameters in assessing the severity of conditions like pulmonary heart disease and hypertension mentioned in the Task Scenario.

4. Given the importance of MAP in understanding the patient's cardiovascular status, the most suitable tool from the Tool List for this scenario is the "Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP)" calculator.

2025-08-20 14:02:45,909 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)
        93.33333333333333
Parameter Listï¼š
{
    "systolic_bp": {"Value": 145, "Unit": "mmHg"},
    "diastolic_bp": {"Value": 85, "Unit": "mmHg"}
}
Analysis:
- For the "systolic_bp" parameter: 
    - Function Docstring Unit: mmHg
    - Parameter List Unit: mmHg
    - Both units are consistent.
- For the "diastolic_bp" parameter: 
    - Function Docstring Unit: mmHg
    - Parameter List Unit: mmHg
    - Both units are consistent.
Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use the same unit of mmHg."
}
