2025-08-20 14:12:23,465 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used for preoperative assessment of cardiac risk in patients.
2. The Task Scenario describes a pregnant patient without any significant acute illnesses or complications, indicating a need for a general assessment of cardiac risk for preoperative purposes.
3. Among the tools provided, the most suitable one for assessing cardiac risk in a preoperative setting is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
4. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.
5. It considers specific risk factors like history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, preoperative insulin treatment, and elevated creatinine levels.
6. By calculating the total score based on these risk factors, healthcare providers can stratify the patient's cardiac risk and make informed decisions regarding further assessments and monitoring.
7. Given that the Task Scenario involves assessing a pregnant patient's cardiac risk for potential surgery, the Revised Cardiac Risk Index aligns well with the core theme of preoperative cardiac risk assessment.
8. Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List based on the User Demand and Task Scenario is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-20 14:12:35,922 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
