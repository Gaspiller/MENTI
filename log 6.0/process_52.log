2025-08-20 14:00:16,580 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to predict the risk of cardiac events, especially for patients with congenital heart disease.
2. Among the tools provided in the list, the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events" aligns most closely with the keywords "risk of cardiac events" and can be used to risk-stratify patients presenting with chest pain.
3. Since the Task Scenario mentions congenital heart disease and the patient's main issues are related to cardiac function impairment, an appropriate tool for assessing the risk of major cardiac events in this context would be the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."
4. The "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events" takes into account factors such as history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels to calculate a total score that categorizes patients into low, moderate, or high risk for acute coronary syndrome.
5. Therefore, based on the User Demand and the Task Scenario, the most suitable tool to choose from the provided list is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-20 14:00:25,549 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
