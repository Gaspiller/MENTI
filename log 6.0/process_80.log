2025-08-20 14:13:14,943 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool specifically used to evaluate the postoperative cardiac risk in patients with preoperative coronary heart disease.
2. Given the Task Scenario which mentions unstable angina pectoris in the patient, it aligns closely with the cardiovascular aspect of the demand, indicating the need for a tool related to cardiac risk assessment.
3. Looking at the Tool List, the most suitable tool for assessing postoperative cardiac risk in patients with preoperative coronary heart disease is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
4. This tool is designed to precisely assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery and is valuable for preoperative risk stratification, aligning with the keywords in the User Demand and the cardiovascular issues presented in the Task Scenario.

2025-08-20 14:13:22,088 - INFO - {{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.

Parameter List：{{{"elevated_risk_surgery": {"Value": true, "Unit": null}, "history_of_ischemic_heart_disease": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, "history_of_congestive_heart_failure": {"Value": true, "Unit": null}, "history_of_cerebrovascular_disease": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, "preop_treatment_with_insulin": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, "preop_creatinine_above_threshold": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:

Parameter: elevated_risk_surgery
Function Docstring Requirement: elevated_risk_surgery should be a boolean value indicating if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
Parameter List Information: "Value": true, "Unit": null
Analysis: The value is consistent with the requirement, so no unit conversion is needed.

Parameter: history_of_ischemic_heart_disease
Function Docstring Requirement: history_of_ischemic_heart_disease should be a boolean value indicating the presence of specific cardiac conditions.
Parameter List Information: "Value": false, "Unit": null
Analysis: The value is consistent with the requirement, so no unit conversion is needed.

Parameter: history_of_congestive_heart_failure
Function Docstring Requirement: history_of_congestive_heart_failure should be a boolean value indicating the presence of signs related to congestive heart failure.
Parameter List Information: "Value": true, "Unit": null
Analysis: The value is consistent with the requirement, so no unit conversion is needed.

Parameter: history_of_cerebrovascular_disease
Function Docstring Requirement: history_of_cerebrovascular_disease should be a boolean value indicating the presence of cerebrovascular disease.
Parameter List Information: "Value": false, "Unit": null
Analysis: The value is consistent with the requirement, so no unit conversion is needed.

Parameter: preop_treatment_with_insulin
Function Docstring Requirement: preop_treatment_with_insulin should be a boolean value indicating if the patient is treated with insulin pre-operatively.
Parameter List Information: "Value": false, "Unit": null
Analysis: The value is consistent with the requirement, so no unit conversion is needed.

Parameter: preop_creatinine_above_threshold
Function Docstring Requirement: preop_creatinine_above_threshold should be a boolean value indicating if pre-operative creatinine levels are above a certain threshold.
Parameter List Information: "Value": false, "Unit": null
Analysis: The value is consistent with the requirement, so no unit conversion is needed.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed."
