2025-08-20 14:16:22,857 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in a patient undergoing non-cardiac surgery. This aligns with the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" tool in the Tool List, as it specifically assesses the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

2. The patient's medical history includes congenital heart disease (ventricular septal defect repair) and potential cardiac issues, which further emphasizes the need for a tool that specifically evaluates the risk of cardiac complications. The "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" would be most suitable for assessing the cardiac risk in this case.

Based on the alignment with the User Demand and the patient's medical history, the most appropriate tool to choose from the Tool List is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-20 14:16:27,722 - INFO - {{"Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
