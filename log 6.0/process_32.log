2025-08-20 13:52:21,202 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool to assess the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease in a patient. The key keywords in the demand are "coronary heart disease" and "10-year risk."

2. The tool that aligns most closely with this demand is the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease." This tool is designed to calculate the risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease in patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease history. It takes into account factors such as age, sex, smoking status, total cholesterol level, HDL cholesterol level, systolic blood pressure, and blood pressure medication.

3. Given that the patient in the scenario has a history of severe hypertension, heart damage, dyslipidemia, smoking, and potential metabolic abnormalities, the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease" is the most appropriate tool to assess the 10-year risk of coronary heart disease in this case.

Therefore, the chosen tool from the Tool List based on the User Demand and Task Scenario is:
```json
{
    "chosen_tool_name": "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease"
}
```

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
    - sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
    - total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    Returns:
    float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.
