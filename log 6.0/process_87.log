2025-08-20 14:16:01,756 - INFO - 1. The user demand is specifically asking for a tool used to assess the risk of cardiac complications post non-cardiac surgery. This aligns with the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" from the tool list as it is designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

2. The scenario mentions the patient's history of ischemic heart disease and left heart dysfunction, indicating a cardiac risk that needs to be evaluated. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index is suitable for assessing such cardiac risks in patients undergoing surgery.

3. The scenario further highlights the patient's condition post right patellar fracture surgery and coronary heart disease with class II heart function. The tool is relevant for assessing the cardiac risk in this patient population undergoing non-cardiac surgery.

Therefore, based on the user demand for a tool to assess cardiac risk post non-cardiac surgery and the patient scenario detailing cardiac concerns, the most suitable tool from the list is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-20 14:16:07,888 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 Âµmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
