2025-08-20 13:59:32,184 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to predict the risk of major cardiac events within 6 weeks after a patient undergoes coronary angiography and left heart catheterization. This indicates a need for a tool that assesses the cardiac risk associated with such procedures.

2. Among the tools provided in the Tool List, the most suitable tool for predicting cardiac events related to coronary procedures is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events." This tool is designed to risk-stratify emergency department patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome, which aligns well with the User Demand criteria.

3. The Task Scenario emphasizes the importance of monitoring the patient's heart health due to the suspicion of cardiovascular issues that could affect blood circulation and myocardial supply. Given the patient's presentation with chest discomfort, shortness of breath, and ECG findings suggestive of myocardial ischemia, the HEART Score can provide valuable insights into the patient's cardiac risk post-procedure.

    "chosen_tool_name": "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events"

2025-08-20 13:59:38,695 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

- The provided parameter list has the correct format with an integer value for the age_score.
- The unit consistency is met, as there is no unit for this parameter.
- No unit conversion or discrepancies found for age_score.

Comparing risk_factors_score:
- Function Docstring specifies the risk_factors_score should be an integer value representing a cardiovascular risk factors score.
- The provided parameter list has the correct format with an integer value for the risk_factors_score.
- The unit consistency is met, as there is no unit for this parameter.
- No unit conversion or discrepancies found for risk_factors_score.

Comparing troponin_score:
