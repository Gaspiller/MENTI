2025-08-20 14:14:47,053 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking which tool is used to assess the postoperative risk for the patient.
2. The Task Scenario describes a 79-year-old male patient presenting with symptoms of cough, back pain persisting for 10 months, and evidence of lung cancer with metastasis to the 6th thoracic vertebra. The patient's condition has not visibly improved, with back tenderness and limited mobility.
3. Given that the patient is undergoing evaluation for lung cancer-related nerve compression or bone metastasis causing back pain and limited mobility, the tool most suitable for assessing postoperative risk in this scenario would be the "SOFA Score" (Sequential Organ Failure Assessment Score).
4. The SOFA Score is commonly used to assess organ dysfunction and risk of failure in critically ill patients, which aligns with the need to evaluate the patient's overall condition and potential postoperative risks in this complex medical case.
5. Therefore, the most suitable tool from the list for assessing the postoperative risk in this patient is the "Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) Score."
