2025-08-20 14:01:47,618 - INFO - 1. The core keyword in the User Demand is "风险" (risk), which indicates the assessment of the patient's risk for major cardiac adverse events.
2. The Task Scenario mentions a patient with acute non-ST elevation inferior wall myocardial infarction causing complete heart block, which can impact cardiac conduction and lead to arrhythmias. Additionally, the patient has type 2 diabetes, posing an increased risk for cardiovascular disease.
3. Considering the patient's condition and the need to evaluate the risk of major cardiac events, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events." This tool specifically assesses the risk of acute coronary syndrome in patients with chest pain, aligning with the scenario of evaluating the risk for major cardiac events in the given patient.
4. The HEART Score evaluates various factors such as history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels to stratify patients into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome, reflecting the need to assess the risk of major cardiac events in the patient with myocardial infarction and diabetes.
5. Therefore, based on the alignment of keywords in the User Demand and the clinical scenario, the most appropriate tool to choose is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-20 14:01:55,706 - INFO - {{"Calculate the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

2. Parameter 'ekg_score':
    Function Docstring Requirement: ekg_score is an int value representing a specific score based on EKG findings.
    Parameter List Information: Value = 2, Unit = null.
    Analysis: The parameter value is correct as an integer value. No unit conversion is needed.
    
3. Parameter 'age_score':
    Function Docstring Requirement: age_score is an int value representing a specific score based on patient's age.
    Parameter List Information: Value = 2, Unit = null.
    Analysis: The parameter value is correct as an integer value. No unit conversion is needed.
    
4. Parameter 'risk_factors_score':
    Function Docstring Requirement: risk_factors_score is an int value representing a specific score based on cardiovascular risk factors.
    Parameter List Information: Value = 2, Unit = null.
    Analysis: The parameter value is correct as an integer value. No unit conversion is needed.
    
5. Parameter 'troponin_score':
