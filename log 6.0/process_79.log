2025-08-20 14:12:49,376 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool used to assess cardiac surgical risk before patella internal fixation surgery. This indicates the need for a cardiac risk assessment tool relevant to the preoperative evaluation for surgery.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with a history of hypertension, heart disease, diabetes, and the presence of a pacemaker. Additionally, the patient has abnormal findings on ECG, enlarged heart post-pacemaker, and ultrasound results indicating potential venous thrombosis in the lower extremities. These findings highlight the cardiovascular comorbidities and potential risks associated with the patient.

3. Given the focus on cardiac risk assessment in the context of surgery, the tool that best matches the User Demand and Task Scenario is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk." This tool is specifically designed to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery based on specific risk factors, which aligns well with the scenario described.

4. By selecting the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk," healthcare providers can evaluate the patient's cardiac risk factors, stratify the risk level, and make informed decisions regarding further preoperative risk assessments and perioperative management strategies.

2025-08-20 14:12:59,633 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
