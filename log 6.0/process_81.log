2025-08-20 14:13:37,948 - INFO - 1. The User Demand mentions evaluating the patient's cardiac risk before undergoing amniocentesis for trisomy 18 termination. This indicates the need for a tool specifically designed to assess cardiac risk in a preoperative setting for a non-cardiac procedure.

2. Among the tools in the Tool List, the most suitable option based on the User Demand would be the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk." This tool is explicitly created for assessing cardiac risk before non-cardiac surgery, aligning perfectly with the scenario described in the User Demand.

3. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index considers factors such as elevated-risk surgery, history of ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, preoperative insulin use, and preoperative creatinine levels. These factors provide a comprehensive evaluation of cardiac risk preoperatively, which is crucial for the scenario of undergoing amniocentesis for trisomy 18 termination where cardiac health assessment is essential.

2025-08-20 14:13:46,057 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
