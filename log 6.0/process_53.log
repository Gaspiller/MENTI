2025-08-20 14:01:24,397 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool that can predict the risk of major cardiac adverse events in heart patients over the next 6 weeks. This aligns with the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events from the Tool List.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with a history of hypertension, type 2 diabetes, and a previous stroke, who presents with acute myocardial infarction. The patient shows EKG changes (T-wave inversion and ST depression) and elevated troponin levels, indicating the severity of the cardiac event. Given these characteristics, the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events is well-suited to assess the patient's risk in this context.

3. The HEART Score takes into account parameters such as history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels, which are all relevant to the presented patient scenario.

Based on the analysis, the most suitable tool from the Tool List for predicting the risk of major cardiac adverse events in the given scenario is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-20 14:01:30,138 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
