2025-08-20 13:51:54,826 - INFO - 1. The user demand mentions "评估患者10年内冠状动脉粥样硬化性心脏病发作风险," which translates to "assessing the risk of coronary artery atherosclerotic heart disease events within 10 years." This aligns closely with the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease from the provided tool list.
2. The Framingham Risk Score is specifically designed to calculate the risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease within a timeframe, making it suitable for assessing the 10-year risk mentioned in the user demand.
3. Given the focus on coronary artery atherosclerotic heart disease events in the patient's case, where the main issue is related to ischemic heart disease and risk assessment, the Framingham Risk Score directly addresses this scenario by providing a risk assessment model for coronary heart disease.
4. Considering the user demand, the core keywords related to coronary artery disease, risk evaluation, and specified time frame strongly point towards the use of the Framingham Risk Score tool.

{{Calculate the Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease in patients aged 30-79 years without prior coronary heart disease history, diabetes, or intermittent claudication.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
    - sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
    - total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    Returns:
    float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.
