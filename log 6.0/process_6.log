2025-08-20 13:41:49,876 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool to assess the stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation.
2. The Task Scenario mentions that the patient has atrial fibrillation as a result of underlying mitral valve stenosis.
3. Among the tools listed, the most suitable tool for assessing stroke risk in patients with atrial fibrillation is the "CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk."
4. This tool is designed to calculate the risk of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation based on various risk factors.
5. Given that the patient in the scenario has atrial fibrillation due to mitral valve stenosis, using the CHA2DS2-VASc Score will provide valuable insights into their stroke risk.
6. Therefore, the chosen tool from the list is the "CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk."

{{"Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
    - history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(75, 'female', True, True, True, True, True)

Parameter Listï¼š
{{{"age": {"Value": 46, "Unit": "years"}, "sex": {"Value": "female", "Unit": null}, "history_of_congestive_heart_failure": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, "history_of_hypertension": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, "history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, "history_of_vascular_disease": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, "history_of_diabetes": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:

For parameter 'age':
Function Docstring specifies the unit as 'int' for age.
The parameter value is 46 years in the Parameter List.
There is no unit conversion required as both the Function Docstring and Parameter List use the same unit. 
Therefore, this parameter complies with the requirements.

For parameter 'sex':
Function Docstring requires 'str' type for the biological sex of the patient.
The parameter value is "female" in the Parameter List.
There is no unit conversion needed for this parameter.
This parameter meets the Function Docstring specifications.

For parameter 'history_of_congestive_heart_failure':
Function Docstring expects a boolean value for the patient's history of congestive heart failure.
The parameter value is 'false' in the Parameter List.
No unit conversion is necessary as the boolean value directly satisfies the requirement.

For parameter 'history_of_hypertension':
Function Docstring specifies a boolean value for the patient's history of hypertension.
The parameter value is 'false' in the Parameter List.
There is no unit conversion required as the boolean value aligns with the function requirements.

For parameter 'history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism':
Function Docstring requires a boolean value for the history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, or thromboembolism.
The parameter value is 'false' in the Parameter List.
No unit conversion is needed as the boolean value fulfills the function's criteria.

For parameter 'history_of_vascular_disease':
The function specifies a boolean value for the history of vascular disease.
The parameter value is 'false' in the Parameter List.
No unit conversion is necessary as the boolean value satisfies the function requirements.

For parameter 'history_of_diabetes':
Function Docstring expects a boolean value for the history of diabetes mellitus.
The parameter value is 'false' in the Parameter List.
No unit conversion is required as the boolean value matches the function's criteria.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters do not require units."
