2. Reviewing the tool descriptions in the Tool List, the tool that directly aligns with assessing stroke risk in atrial fibrillation patients is the "CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk."
3. The CHA2DS2-VASc Score is specifically designed to estimate the risk of stroke in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation, precisely the scenario presented in the User Demand.
4. By calculating the CHA2DS2-VASc Score, clinicians can determine the necessity for anticoagulation therapy based on the patient's stroke risk profile.
5. Given the focus on stroke risk assessment in atrial fibrillation patients, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List is the "CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk."

2025-08-20 13:42:25,884 - INFO - {{"Calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc Score for Atrial Fibrillation Stroke Risk.

    The CHA2DS2-VASc score is a clinical prediction rule for estimating the risk of stroke in
    patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation. It is used to determine whether treatment with
    anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy is appropriate, based on the risk of thromboembolism.

    Parameters:
    - age (int): Age of the patient.
    - sex (str): Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
    - history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
    - history_of_hypertension (bool): True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
    - history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism (bool): True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
    - history_of_vascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
    - history_of_diabetes (bool): True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.

    Returns:
    - int: The total CHA2DS2-VASc score which is a sum of the points for each risk factor.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_cha2ds2_vasc_score(75, 'female', True, True, True, True, True)
    9}}

Parameter List：
{{{"age": {"Value": 38, "Unit": "years"}, 
"sex": {"Value": "male", "Unit": null}, 
"history_of_congestive_heart_failure": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, 
"history_of_hypertension": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, 
"history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, 
"history_of_vascular_disease": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}, 
"history_of_diabetes": {"Value": false, "Unit": null}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:

Parameter: age 
Function Docstring: Age of the patient.
Parameter List: Value = 38, Unit = years
Comparison: The age provided in the parameter list is in years, which is consistent with the requirement in the function docstring.
Decision: Calculate

Parameter: sex
Function Docstring: Biological sex of the patient, 'male' or 'female'.
Parameter List: Value = "male", Unit = null
Comparison: The unit for sex is not applicable as it is a categorical variable. The value "male" provided in the parameter list is consistent with the requirement in the function docstring.
Decision: Calculate

Parameter: history_of_congestive_heart_failure 
Function Docstring: True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, otherwise False.
Parameter List: Value = false, Unit = null
Comparison: The value false for history_of_congestive_heart_failure provided in the parameter list is consistent with the requirement in the function docstring.
Decision: Calculate

Parameter: history_of_hypertension 
Function Docstring: True if the patient has a history of hypertension, otherwise False.
Parameter List: Value = false, Unit = null
Comparison: The value false for history_of_hypertension provided in the parameter list is consistent with the requirement in the function docstring.
Decision: Calculate

Parameter: history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism 
Function Docstring: True if the patient has a history of stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), or thromboembolism, otherwise False.
Parameter List: Value = false, Unit = null
Comparison: The value false for history_of_stroke_tia_thromboembolism provided in the parameter list is consistent with the requirement in the function docstring.
Decision: Calculate

Parameter: history_of_vascular_disease 
Function Docstring: True if the patient has a history of vascular disease (prior myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, or aortic plaque), otherwise False.
Parameter List: Value = false, Unit = null
Comparison: The value false for history_of_vascular_disease provided in the parameter list is consistent with the requirement in the function docstring.
Decision: Calculate

Parameter: history_of_diabetes 
Function Docstring: True if the patient has a history of diabetes mellitus, otherwise False.
Parameter List: Value = false, Unit = null
Comparison: The value false for history_of_diabetes provided in the parameter list is consistent with the requirement in the function docstring.
Decision: Calculate

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters are categorical or boolean."
