2025-08-20 13:58:22,439 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool that predicts the risk of major cardiac events within 6 weeks for a patient. This indicates a need for a tool that specifically assesses cardiac risk for adverse events like myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest, or other significant cardiac complications.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with various cardiac abnormalities, including left ventricular hypertrophy, reduced ventricular function, valve regurgitation, and pulmonary hypertension. These abnormalities emphasize the importance of assessing the patient's cardiac risk for potential adverse events accurately.

3. Among the provided tools, the most suitable choice for predicting the risk of major cardiac events within 6 weeks for the described patient is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events." This tool calculates the risk of acute coronary syndrome in patients presenting with chest pain by considering factors such as history, EKG findings, age, risk factors, and troponin levels.

Based on the alignment rules, the HEART Score is explicitly designed to assess the risk of major cardiac events, making it the most appropriate choice given the User Demand and the clinical case description.

2025-08-20 13:58:31,635 - INFO - {{Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

Analysis: 
- history_score: The Function Docstring requires an integer score (0, 1, or 2) based on patient history assessment. The Parameter List provides a value of 1, which aligns with the requirements. No unit conversion is needed.
- ekg_score: The Function Docstring requires an integer score (0, 1, or 2) based on EKG findings. The Parameter List provides a value of 2, which aligns with the requirements. No unit conversion is needed.
- age_score: The Function Docstring requires an integer score (0, 1, or 2) based on patient's age. The Parameter List provides a value of 2, which aligns with the requirements. No unit conversion is needed.
- risk_factors_score: The Function Docstring requires an integer score (0, 1, or 2) based on number of cardiovascular risk factors. The Parameter List provides a value of 0, which aligns with the requirements. No unit conversion is needed.
- troponin_score: The Function Docstring requires an integer score (0, 1, or 2) based on initial troponin levels. The Parameter List provides a value of 2, which aligns with the requirements. No unit conversion is needed.
