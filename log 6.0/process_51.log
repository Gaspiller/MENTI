2025-08-20 13:59:54,222 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool used to predict the risk of major cardiac events in patients within 6 weeks. This aligns with the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events from the Tool List, as it specifically assesses the risk of acute coronary syndrome, which includes major cardiac events.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with a history of intermittent chest tightness, palpitations, shortness of breath for 12 years, worsened symptoms for 1 day with documented arrhythmias, atrial fibrillation, and premature ventricular contractions. The patient also has abnormal ECG findings and elevated BNP levels, suggesting heart failure and NYHA Class IV. Additionally, there is a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and abnormal liver function tests, indicating potential liver dysfunction. These clinical details are highly indicative of cardiac issues, aligning with the purpose of the HEART Score.

Based on the alignment of the User Demand for predicting major cardiac events and the detailed clinical information provided in the Task Scenario related to cardiac issues, the suitable tool to choose is:

2025-08-20 13:59:59,409 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

Parameter List:
{{{"history_score": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, "ekg_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null}, "age_score": {"Value": 2, "Unit": null}, "risk_factors_score": {"Value": 1, "Unit": null}, "troponin_score": {"Value": 0, "Unit": null}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
Check Parameter: history_score
Function Docstring specifies it as an integer with values that represent different levels of suspicion based on patient history.
Parameter List entry is consistent with the Function Docstring.

Check Parameter: ekg_score
Function Docstring specifies it as an integer with values representing different EKG findings.
Parameter List entry is consistent with the Function Docstring.

Check Parameter: age_score
Function Docstring specifies it as an integer with values representing different age groups.
Parameter List entry is consistent with the Function Docstring.

Check Parameter: risk_factors_score
Function Docstring specifies it as an integer with values representing different risk factor categories.
Parameter List entry is consistent with the Function Docstring.

Check Parameter: troponin_score
Function Docstring specifies it as an integer with values representing different troponin level categories.
Parameter List entry is consistent with the Function Docstring.
