2025-08-20 14:29:44,763 - INFO - 1. The User Demand is asking for a tool that assesses the cardiac risk of pre-operative patients. This aligns with the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk" tool from the Tool List.

2. The Task Scenario mentions the history of the patient, including drug ingestion leading to acute poisoning, right chest and abdominal stab wounds, and possible liver contusions. These factors indicate a need to evaluate the cardiac risk of the patient, especially considering the potential effects of the injuries on cardiac function.

3. Given that the primary concern in the Task Scenario is assessing the cardiac risk of a pre-operative patient with a history of chest and abdominal trauma that may affect cardiac function, the most suitable tool from the Tool List is the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-20 14:29:57,083 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 Âµmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.
