2025-08-20 14:08:56,498 - INFO - 1. The core keyword in the User Demand is "CAP（社区获得性肺炎）的严重程度" (severity of CAP - Community-Acquired Pneumonia).
2. The Task Scenario provides details of a 66-year-old female farmer with symptoms suggestive of pneumonia and imaging findings consistent with lung inflammation.
3. The information indicates the need to assess the severity of pneumonia in this patient, considering the provided clinical data and laboratory results.
4. From the Tool List, the most suitable tool for evaluating the severity of CAP in this case is the "PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP."
5. The PSI/PORT Score specifically helps risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia, considering various clinical parameters.
6. Given the emphasis on pneumonia severity and the patient's presentation, using the PSI/PORT Score aligns with the core medical intent in the User Demand.
7. Therefore, the chosen tool for evaluating the severity of CAP in this scenario is the "PSI/PORT Score: Pneumonia Severity Index for CAP."

{"Calculate the PSI/PORT Score for Community-Acquired Pneumonia (CAP).

    The PSI/PORT Score helps to risk stratify patients with community-acquired pneumonia in clinical or
    emergency department settings. This score may underestimate severe pneumonia in younger, otherwise healthy patients.
    It is important to consider other clinical factors such as sepsis, which may require additional testing
    like lactate levels. Any patient over 50 years of age is automatically classified as risk class 2.

    Parameters:
    age (int): Patient's age in years.
    sex (str): Patient's sex, either 'Female' or 'Male'.
    nursing_home_resident (bool): True if the patient is a nursing home resident, False otherwise.
    neoplastic_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of neoplastic disease, False otherwise.
    liver_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of liver disease, False otherwise.
    chf_history (bool): True if the patient has a history of congestive heart failure, False otherwise.
    cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of cerebrovascular disease, False otherwise.
    renal_disease (bool): True if the patient has a history of renal disease, False otherwise.
    altered_mental_status (bool): True if the patient has altered mental status, False otherwise.
    respiratory_rate (bool): True if respiratory rate is ≥30 breaths/min, False otherwise.
    systolic_bp (bool): True if systolic blood pressure is <90 mmHg, False otherwise.
    temperature (bool): True if temperature is <35°C or >39.9°C, False otherwise.
    pulse (bool): True if pulse rate is ≥125 beats/min, False otherwise.
    blood_ph (bool): True if blood pH is <7.35, False otherwise.
    bun (bool): True if BUN is ≥30 mg/dL or ≥11 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    sodium (bool): True if sodium level is <130 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    glucose (bool): True if glucose level is ≥250 mg/dL or ≥14 mmol/L, False otherwise.
    hematocrit (bool): True if hematocrit is <30%, False otherwise.
    oxygen_pressure (bool): True if partial pressure of oxygen is <60 mmHg or <8 kPa, False otherwise.
    pleural_effusion (bool): True if there is pleural effusion on x-ray, False otherwise.

    Returns:
    int: The total PSI/PORT Score indicating the severity of the pneumonia.}
