2025-08-20 14:02:15,453 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool that is used to predict the risk of major cardiac adverse events within 6 weeks.
2. The Task Scenario provides information about a patient diagnosed with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, hypertension, and hyperlipidemia, experiencing chest pain and showing signs of arterial stenosis.
3. Given the focus on predicting major cardiac events and the patient's cardiovascular history, the most suitable tool from the Tool List would be the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."
4. The HEART Score is designed to risk-stratify patients presenting with chest pain in the emergency department into low, moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome.
5. The tool considers factors like history, EKG findings, age, cardiovascular risk factors, and troponin levels to calculate a total score that guides further management and categorizes risk levels.
6. Considering the patient's symptoms, cardiovascular history, and the need for risk prediction of major cardiac events, the HEART Score aligns perfectly with the core medical intent in the User Demand and the patient's case details.

2025-08-20 14:02:27,735 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
