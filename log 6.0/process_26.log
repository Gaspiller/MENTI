2025-08-20 13:49:57,709 - INFO - 1. The core keyword in the User Demand is "肝纤维化" (liver fibrosis).
2. The Task Scenario specifies that the patient's condition is related to "药物性肝损伤" (drug-induced liver injury) caused by long-term medication use.
3. The liver function tests indicated significantly elevated AST and ALT levels, pointing towards liver damage and inflammation, which are key indicators for assessing liver fibrosis progression.
4. Among the tools in the Tool List, the most suitable tool for evaluating the level of liver fibrosis in this drug-induced liver injury scenario is the "Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis".
5. The FIB-4 Index is specifically designed to estimate the level of liver fibrosis in patients with risk factors for liver disease, such as chronic hepatitis or drug-induced liver injury, making it a fitting choice for assessing the patient's liver condition in this case.

Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) Index for Liver Fibrosis.

    This function calculates the FIB-4 Index, a non-invasive scoring system used to estimate the
    level of liver fibrosis. It is particularly useful for patients with risk factors for liver disease
    such as chronic hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, NAFLD, and other liver conditions. The FIB-4
    Index helps monitor liver fibrosis over time without the need for invasive procedures like liver
    biopsy, which carries risks and may only provide a limited assessment due to sampling errors.

    Parameters:
        age (int or float): Age of the patient in years.
        ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L.
        platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L).
        alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L.

    Returns:
        float: The FIB-4 Index score, which can be used to categorize liver fibrosis into mild,
               moderate, or severe stages.

    Note:
        The accuracy of FIB-4 Index may be reduced in patients younger than 35 or older than 65 years.

Parameter List：
{{{"age": {"Value": 36, "Unit": "岁"}, "ast": {"Value": 560, "Unit": "U/L"}, "platelets": {"Value": 190, "Unit": "× 10⁹/L"}, "alt": {"Value": 890, "Unit": "U/L"}}}}

Step By Step Analysis:

1. Parameter "age":
Function Docstring: "age (int or float): Age of the patient in years."
Parameter List: "age": {"Value": 36, "Unit": "岁"}
Comparison: The unit provided in the Parameter List is in "岁" (years). This matches the requirement in the Function Docstring. 
Decision: calculate

2. Parameter "ast":
Function Docstring: "ast (float): Aspartate aminotransferase level in U/L."
Parameter List: "ast": {"Value": 560, "Unit": "U/L"}
Comparison: The unit provided in the Parameter List is in "U/L" (Units per Liter). This matches the requirement in the Function Docstring. 
Decision: calculate

3. Parameter "platelets":
Function Docstring: "platelets (float): Platelet count is measured in units of × 10⁹ per liter (× 10⁹ / L)."
Parameter List: "platelets": {"Value": 190, "Unit": "× 10⁹/L"}
Comparison: The unit provided in the Parameter List is in "× 10⁹/L" (billions per liter). This matches the requirement in the Function Docstring. 
Decision: calculate

4. Parameter "alt":
Function Docstring: "alt (float): Alanine aminotransferase level in U/L."
Parameter List: "alt": {"Value": 890, "Unit": "U/L"}
Comparison: The unit provided in the Parameter List is in "U/L" (Units per Liter). This matches the requirement in the Function Docstring. 
Decision: calculate
