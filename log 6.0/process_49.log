2025-08-20 13:59:08,134 - INFO - 1. The User Demand mentions predicting the risk of major cardiac events within 6 weeks, which aligns with the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events from the provided tool list. This tool is specifically designed to risk-stratify patients with chest pain for acute coronary syndrome, which involves assessing the likelihood of major cardiac events.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with third-degree atrioventricular (AV) block, a condition affecting the conduction between the atria and ventricles, potentially leading to heart rhythm disturbances. The treatment mentioned is the implantation of a dual-chamber pacemaker to address the conduction issue. While the scenario involves a heart conduction abnormality, the focus remains on the risk of cardiac events post-treatment, which directly connects to assessing the risk through the HEART Score.

3. Given the primary concern in the Task Scenario is the management and potential outcomes post dual-chamber pacemaker implantation related to the underlying condition and risks of major cardiac events, the most suitable tool from the provided list is the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events.

{{"Calculate the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7
