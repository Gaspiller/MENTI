2025-08-20 13:46:06,221 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks which tool is used to evaluate a patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR), which directly aligns with the tool "CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)" in the Tool List.

2. The Task Scenario mentions multiple factors related to kidney function, including right kidney atrophy, left kidney hydronephrosis, chronic renal failure, and perinephric infiltration, indicating potential kidney impairment. This reinforces the relevance of assessing the patient's kidney function, making the CKD-EPI Equations tool the most suitable choice.

3. The CKD-EPI tool is designed to estimate kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is specifically intended for patients with chronic kidney disease, which fits the patient's case as they have chronic renal failure. By inputting the patient's serum creatinine level, age, and gender, this tool can provide an estimated GFR crucial for assessing kidney function.

Therefore, based on the User Demand and the patient's case details, the most suitable tool to choose is the CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR).

{{Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate)
    without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended
    for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to 
    assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients
    with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

    Parameters:
    - serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years.
    - gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

    Returns:
    - float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

    Usage:
    To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
    For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

    Note:
    - Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
    - Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass.
