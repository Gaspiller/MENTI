2025-08-20 13:58:49,844 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool that predicts the risk of major cardiac events in patients within the next 6 weeks. This aligns with the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events tool from the provided Tool List.

2. The Task Scenario describes a patient with significant cardiac abnormalities, including atrial fibrillation, valvular heart disease, and history of hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, obesity, and smoking. These conditions increase the risk of major cardiac events, making the assessment of such risk crucial in this case.

3. The HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events is designed to risk-stratify patients with chest pain into low, moderate, and high-risk categories for acute coronary syndrome, a condition that can lead to major cardiac events. Given the patient's complex cardiac history and symptoms, using the HEART Score can help guide further management and interventions.

Based on the alignment of the User Demand for predicting major cardiac events and the patient's complex cardiac condition described in the Task Scenario, the most suitable tool to choose from the Tool List is the "HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events."

2025-08-20 13:58:54,647 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{ Calculates the HEART Score for Major Cardiac Events based on five categories:
    History, EKG, Age, Risk factors, and Troponin level. This score helps to
    risk-stratify emergency department (ED) patients with chest pain into low,
    moderate, and high-risk groups for acute coronary syndrome (ACS).

    Args:
    history_score (int): Score based on patient history assessment, where:
        0 = Slightly suspicious,
        1 = Moderately suspicious,
        2 = Highly suspicious.
    ekg_score (int): Score based on EKG findings, where:
        0 = Normal,
        1 = Non-specific repolarization disturbance,
        2 = Significant ST deviation.
    age_score (int): Score based on patient's age, where:
        0 = less than 45,
        1 = between 45 and 64,
        2 = 65 or older.
    risk_factors_score (int): Score based on number of cardiovascular risk factors, where:
        0 = No known risk factors,
        1 = 1–2 risk factors,
        2 = 3 or more risk factors or history of atherosclerotic disease.
    troponin_score (int): Score based on initial troponin levels, where:
        0 = ≤ normal limit,
        1 = 1–3 times normal limit,
        2 = >3 times normal limit.

    Returns:
    int: The total HEART score, which can guide further management of chest pain patients
         in the emergency setting. Total scores categorize risk as follows:
         0-3 points indicate low risk,
         4-6 points indicate moderate risk,
         7-10 points indicate high risk.

    Example:
    >>> calculate_heart_score(2, 1, 1, 2, 1)
    7

Step By Step Analysis:

The Function Docstring requires the scores for history, EKG, age, risk factors, and troponin levels to be integers without specific units. The provided Parameter List contains the values for each score in the correct format.
