2025-08-20 14:28:30,418 - INFO - 1. The user demand specifically asks for a tool used to calculate the actual sodium level in hyperglycemic patients. This aligns with the "Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia" tool from the provided list.

2. The user's case mentions Type 2 diabetes with poor blood sugar control, leading to symptoms related to hyperglycemia. This directly links to the calculation of corrected sodium levels in hyperglycemic patients.

3. The calculated corrected sodium levels in hyperglycemic patients are crucial for assessing electrolyte imbalances that may occur due to shifts in water content in the body associated with high glucose levels.

Based on the user demand and the medical scenario provided, the most suitable tool from the list is the "Sodium Correction for Hyperglycemia".

2025-08-20 14:28:33,418 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Corrected Sodium for Hyperglycemia using Hillier's method from 1999.

    Parameters:
        measured_sodium (float): The measured sodium level in mEq/L.
        serum_glucose (float): The serum glucose level in mg/dL.

    Returns:
        float: The corrected sodium level in mEq/L.
}}

Parameter List:
{{{
    "measured_sodium": {"Value": 143.0, "Unit": "mEq/L"},
    "serum_glucose": {"Value": 216.22, "Unit": "mg/dL"}
}}}

Step By Step Analysis:
For measured_sodium:
- Function Docstring specifies the unit in mEq/L.
- The provided value in the Parameter List is 143.0 mEq/L.
- The unit in the Parameter List complies with the requirements in the Function Docstring.

For serum_glucose:
- Function Docstring specifies the unit in mg/dL.
- The provided value in the Parameter List is 216.22 mg/dL.
- The unit in the Parameter List complies with the requirements in the Function Docstring.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters use the same units specified in the Function Docstring."
