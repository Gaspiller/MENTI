2025-08-20 14:15:33,521 - INFO - 1. The user demand specifically asks for a tool that assesses the risk of postoperative cardiac complications in non-cardiac surgery patients.
2. The Case Scenario mentions that the patient has main issues related to a right inguinal hernia and other cardiac conditions like congenital right ventricular abnormality and incomplete right bundle branch block. However, the primary concern for treatment is the right inguinal hernia requiring surgical repair.
3. Considering the core focus on postoperative cardiac complications in non-cardiac surgery patients, the most suitable tool from the provided list would be the "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."
4. The Revised Cardiac Risk Index specifically assesses the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery, aligning perfectly with the user demand for evaluating postoperative cardiac risks in non-cardiac surgery patients.
5. Therefore, the chosen tool from the tool list for this scenario is "Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk."

2025-08-20 14:15:44,396 - INFO - Function Docstring:
{{Calculate the Revised Cardiac Risk Index for Pre-Operative Risk.

    This function calculates the Revised Cardiac Risk Index, which is used to assess the risk of major cardiac complications in patients undergoing elective or urgent/semi-urgent non-cardiac surgery. It is based on a set of specific risk factors and is valuable for risk stratification and aiding discussions about informed consent with patients.

    Parameters:
    elevated_risk_surgery (bool): True if the surgery is intraperitoneal, intrathoracic, or suprainguinal vascular.
    history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
    history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
    history_of_cerebrovascular_disease (bool): True if there is a history of transient ischemic attack or stroke.
    preop_treatment_with_insulin (bool): True if the patient is being treated with insulin pre-operatively.
    preop_creatinine_above_threshold (bool): True if pre-operative creatinine levels are greater than 2 mg/dL or 176.8 µmol/L.

    Returns:
    int: The total Revised Cardiac Risk Index score, which is the sum of the individual risk factors present.

    Usage:
    The index is used primarily in the preoperative setting to assess cardiac risk. It assists healthcare providers in making informed decisions about further preoperative risk assessments and postoperative monitoring.

Analysis: The unit for this parameter is boolean, which is consistent with the function docstring requirements.

Parameter 2: history_of_ischemic_heart_disease
Function Docstring: history_of_ischemic_heart_disease (bool): True if there is a history of myocardial infarction, positive exercise test, current chest pain considered due to myocardial ischemia, or use of nitrate therapy or ECG showing pathological Q waves.
Parameter List: false
Analysis: The unit for this parameter is boolean, which is consistent with the function docstring requirements.

Parameter 3: history_of_congestive_heart_failure
Function Docstring: history_of_congestive_heart_failure (bool): True if there are signs such as pulmonary edema, bilateral rales or S3 gallop, paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea, or chest X-ray showing pulmonary vascular redistribution.
Parameter List: false
Analysis: The unit for this parameter is boolean, which is consistent with the function docstring requirements.
