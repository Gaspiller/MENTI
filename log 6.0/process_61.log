2025-08-20 14:04:28,454 - INFO - To assess the patient's Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) in the given scenario where the patient is experiencing a hypertensive crisis with a systolic blood pressure of 240mmHg and diastolic blood pressure also being high, alongside the presence of lacunar infarcts in the basal ganglia on CT imaging indicating possible improper blood pressure control-induced hypertensive crisis, a suitable tool from the Tool List is the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) calculator.

The MAP tool is specifically designed to calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure, which is a key metric used in assessing tissue perfusion and blood flow, particularly important in medical emergencies like hypertensive crises. The formula to calculate MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP, where SBP is the systolic blood pressure and DBP is the diastolic blood pressure.

Given the scenario, the elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressures align with the need to evaluate the patient's MAP to understand the perfusion pressure across organs, including the brain, affected by the hypertensive crisis and lacunar infarcts. By choosing the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) tool, we can accurately calculate this essential parameter for monitoring the patient's condition and guiding further management to mitigate complications associated with the hypertensive crisis and cerebral infarcts.

Calculate the Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) from the systolic (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP).
    
    MAP is a crucial health metric used to assess tissue perfusion and blood flow. It is particularly important in
    medical scenarios such as sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleeding, and hypertensive emergencies.
    The formula used for calculating MAP is: MAP = 1/3 * SBP + 2/3 * DBP.
    
    Parameters:
        systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mmHg.
        diastolic_bp (float): Diastolic blood pressure in mmHg.
    
    Returns:
        float: The calculated mean arterial pressure in mmHg.
    
    Example:
        >>> calculate_mean_arterial_pressure(120, 80)

Step By Step Analysis: 

1. Parameter: systolic_bp
Function Docstring Info: systolic_bp should be in mmHg.
Parameter List Info: systolic_bp is given as 240 mmHg.

Conclusion for systolic_bp: All units are consistent.

2. Parameter: diastolic_bp
Function Docstring Info: diastolic_bp should be in mmHg.
Parameter List Info: diastolic_bp is given as 140 mmHg.

Conclusion for diastolic_bp: All units are consistent.
