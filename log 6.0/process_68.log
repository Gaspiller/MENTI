2025-08-20 14:07:10,126 - INFO - Function Docstring:
Calculate the estimated due date (EDD) for a pregnancy based on the last menstrual period and cycle length.

    This function uses a standard method recommended by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),
    which considers the first trimester ultrasound measurements to be the most accurate method to establish gestational age.

    Parameters:
    - cycle_length (int): The length of the menstrual cycle in days. Standard cycle is 28 days.
                           If cycle_length is more than 28, the difference is added to the 40-week period.
    - last_menstrual_period (str): The first day of the last menstrual period in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

    Returns:
    - str: The estimated due date in the format 'Day, Month DD, YYYY'.

    Usage:
    The function is intended for use by healthcare providers to estimate due dates for pregnant patients,
    which can help in managing pregnancy timelines effectively and in planning medical care accordingly.

    Example:
    'Monday, Oct 16, 2023'

Parameter: cycle_length
Value: 28
Unit: day
Function Docstring requirement: cycle_length should be in days.

Parameter List value for cycle_length: 28
Parameter List unit for cycle_length: day

Comparison:
The units match the requirements of the function docstring.

Parameter: last_menstrual_period
Value: 2019/05/19
Unit: YYYY/MM/DD
Function Docstring requirement: last_menstrual_period should be in 'YYYY/MM/DD' format.

Parameter List value for last_menstrual_period: 2019/05/19
Parameter List unit for last_menstrual_period: YYYY/MM/DD

Comparison:
The units match the requirements of the function docstring.

Final Answer:
```json
{
    "chosen_decision_name": "calculate",
    "supplementary_information": "All parameters comply with the Function Docstring requirements. No unit conversion is needed as the parameters already use the correct format."
}
