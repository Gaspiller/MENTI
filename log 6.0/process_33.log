2025-08-20 13:52:43,856 - INFO - 1. The User Demand asks for a tool to assess the 10-year risk of developing coronary heart disease in a patient.
2. Considering the Task Scenario provided, the patient has symptoms of episodic consciousness disorders, low blood sugar levels, abnormal cholesterol levels, and inadequate blood pressure control, which may contribute to insufficient cerebral blood supply and episodic consciousness disorders.
3. Given the focus on assessing the risk of coronary heart disease, the tool that aligns with this scenario and demand is the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease."
4. The Framingham Risk Score is designed to calculate the risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease, specifically for patients aged 30-79 without prior coronary heart disease, diabetes, or intermittent claudication.
5. The parameters required for the Framingham Risk Score are age, sex, smoker status, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, systolic blood pressure, and blood pressure medication status, which can help assess the patient's risk of coronary heart disease based on the provided information.
6. Therefore, the most suitable tool for this scenario and demand is the "Framingham Risk Score for Hard Coronary Heart Disease."

    Parameters:
    - age (int): The age of the patient in years. Valid range: 30-79.
    - sex (int): The sex of the patient. 0 for female, 1 for male.
    - smoker_status (int): Smoking status of the patient. 0 for non-smoker, 1 for smoker.
    - total_cholesterol (float): Total cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - hdl_cholesterol (float): HDL cholesterol level in mg/dL.
    - systolic_bp (float): Systolic blood pressure in mm Hg.
    - bp_medication (int): Indicates if the blood pressure is being treated with medications. 0 for no, 1 for yes.

    Returns:
    float: The risk percentage of developing hard coronary heart disease.

    Calculation is based on the logarithmic transformations of risk factors and their interactions,
    separately for males and females. Note that older population data was used to develop this scale,
    which may not fully align with current population risks.
