2025-08-20 13:46:24,889 - INFO - 1. The User Demand specifically asks for a tool to evaluate a patient's glomerular filtration rate (GFR). This aligns with the "CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)" tool from the Tool List, as it is designed to calculate the GFR using creatinine-based equations for patients with chronic kidney disease.

2. The Task Scenario mentions abnormalities related to kidney function, including elevated serum creatinine levels and proteinuria, which are key indicators of impaired kidney function. These abnormalities directly relate to the evaluation of GFR, making the "CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)" tool the most suitable choice.

3. Considering the patient's presentation with gross hematuria, proteinuria, and edema in both lower limbs, the focus on kidney function assessment through GFR calculation is essential for further evaluation and treatment planning in this case.

Based on the alignment of the core keywords in the User Demand and the relevance to the patient's case scenario, the most appropriate tool to choose is the "CKD-EPI Equations for Glomerular Filtration Rate (GFR)".

2025-08-20 13:46:31,208 - INFO - {{"Calculate the 2021 CKD-EPI (Chronic Kidney Disease Epidemiology Collaboration) GFR (Glomerular Filtration Rate) without the race component. This function estimates kidney function using creatinine-based equations and is intended for patients with chronic (not acute) kidney disease. This calculation is particularly used by nephrologists to assess kidney function non-invasively and is considered more accurate than the MDRD Equation, especially in patients with normal or mildly reduced eGFR.

Parameters:
- serum_creatinine (float): The serum creatinine level of the patient in mg/dL.
- age (int): The age of the patient in years.
- gender (int): The gender of the patient. Use 0 for male and 1 for female.

Returns:
- float: The estimated GFR in ml/min/1.73m^2.

Usage:
To use this function, provide the serum creatinine level, age, and gender index (0 for male, 1 for female).
For example, calculate_ckd_epi_gfr(0.9, 30, 0) calculates the GFR for a 30-year-old male with a serum creatinine of 0.9 mg/dL.

Note:
- Not intended for use in patients on dialysis.
- Less accurate in patients with diabetes (before progression to overt nephropathy), pregnant women, and those with unusual body mass."}}
